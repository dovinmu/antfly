## 2026-09-25: progressive activation observations during admission maintenance

[Main job 108330133910](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36213445604/job/108330133910)
failed `test_progressive_index_is_semantically_queryable_before_full_coverage`:
`semantic_title_live` retained `runtime_unavailable` beyond the five-second
activation deadline while `semantic_progressive` continued serving its partial
generation under provider throttling. Server output records the second index's
native checkpoint installation followed by bounded-maintenance waiting. The
job finished with 762 passed, one failed, and seven skipped.

The compiled structural path discarded a fresh resident observation whenever
its maintenance result was `busy`. The outer scheduler also published only
when a plan group completed. This unnecessarily tied visibility of an installed
index to completion of its admission maintenance. Fresh observations now pass
through the existing leadership, catalog, physical-root, and exact-incarnation
publication fences even when the group remains pending. Coverage, replay debt,
and maintenance completion retain their own proofs; observing a runtime does
not declare the index ready. A bounded quantum visits each initially pending
group at most once, avoiding duplicate observations and repeated work when a
busy group rotates back to the head of a small plan.

Enrichment reconfiguration also joined an inline provider retry implemented as
an ordinary executor sleep. Its delay could reach five seconds, and publishing
shutdown to the runtime condition did not wake that separate sleep. Retry and
interactive-yield waits now use a sticky lifecycle event with their original
monotonic deadline. Teardown wakes them immediately, including a signal that
arrives before wait admission; spurious wakes do not shorten or extend normal
backoff. The event resets only when the preceding worker/replay owner has
joined and a replacement starts. The same teardown entry point publishes
provider cancellation, and provider admission rejects further dispatch after
shutdown. The existing lifetime drain still waits for any callback already
using runtime/provider-owned memory.

A deterministic regression admits a 60-second backoff, signals teardown both
before admission and while the event is actually waiting, and requires the
owner to return. Restoring the original sleep makes this regression fail with
`Timeout`; the fixed wait passes. The test also rejects provider admission
after teardown. It is included in the enrichment ownership suite. All 12
focused backoff, retry isolation, restart, and visibility regressions passed
without skips, failures, or leaks.

The deterministic compiled-owner regression forces busy maintenance with a
fresh exact index observation, checks publication from the scheduler quantum,
retains pending coverage and plan debt, and checks one visit per group. Missing
observations remain blocked. All 30 compiled-owner source regressions passed
without skips, failures, or leaks. The focused lifecycle/fence selection also
passed 23 tests without skips, failures, or leaks. Ten unchanged-server local
reproductions passed; they did not reproduce the original CI timeout. These
results establish the publication and backoff-wakeup bugs, but the CI logs do
not prove a sole cause of delay on that runner. The test's five-second
activation deadline is unchanged.

The final native CPU ReleaseFast build passed all 35 steps; a second build of
the frozen source was fully cached. A frozen binary from `d23eeeb591`, including
both activation fixes, atomic quantized preparation, and the merge of
`origin/main` at `cc9be026f9`, passed **200/200** independent invocations through
the repository flake loop (four workers, 50 repetitions each). All 200 JUnit
cases passed with zero errors, failures, or skips. Recorded activation times
were 67.7 ms median, 71.8 ms p95, and 75.4 ms maximum. These are local gate
measurements, not evidence of a before/after latency improvement.

Reproduction from the repository root, after building the native CPU binary:

```sh
SKIP_BUILD=1 ANTFLY_E2E_ENV_LOADED=1 \
ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_WORKERS=4 \
ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPEATS=50 \

scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh \
  e2e/antfly/test_quickstart.py::test_progressive_index_is_semantically_queryable_before_full_coverage
```

The validation run used a frozen copy of that binary at
`/private/tmp/pr890-progressive-final-binary/antfly`. Local evidence is retained
in `/private/tmp/pr890-progressive-final-soak-200.log`, the report directory
above, `/private/tmp/pr890-progressive-final-soak-build.json` (binary/source
hashes), and `/private/tmp/pr890-progressive-final-soak-summary.json`.

## 2026-09-25: main HA promotion retry and CPU inference diagnostics

[Main run 36200131260](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36200131260)
failed HA `test_empty_seed_then_first_table_replication_and_fenced_promotion`
with a 500 response after `MetadataHABindingBusy` and `HAPrimaryNotConfigured`.
Promotion had already transferred its primary WAL to the runtime, but an
unconditional local `errdefer` closed that transferred handle when metadata
binding failed. Promotion also discarded its retry configuration before
binding completed. The runtime now retains ownership and the retry state,
and keeps public reads and writes gated until every binding succeeds.
The background loop treats metadata binding contention as nonfatal and retains
its exact diagnostic while scheduling another round.
The deterministic regression injects repeated metadata binding contention,
checks closed public gates, retries successfully, and tears down without leaks.

The same run's inference suite timed out in dictate cleanup after 600 seconds;
four later dictate requests and three embedding requests returned capacity
errors. Two local CPU baseline invocations completed in 182 and 158 seconds,
so the CI timeout has not been reproduced locally. Their supervisor cleanup
failed under the local sandbox's process-group signaling restrictions; these
are test-level observations, not successful soak invocations. A CPU sample
identified whole-table matrix preparation during Gemma PLE row gathering.
Gather-only weight lookup now retains raw quantized rows and skips matrix
packing, including on the lazy-load path. Other backends retain their existing
weight lookup semantics, and ordinary matrix consumers retain preparation.
Regressions cover exact row values, raw-only request accounting, reservation
release, lazy handle pins, and later matrix preparation. Shared request
reservations grow once when a matrix borrower needs a larger footprint; a
denied growth does not add a borrower or leak its original charge. Matrix
preparation now stages all new layouts and publishes them atomically. If a
later allocation fails, only the newly allocated buffers are freed; existing
layouts and raw rows survive, and retained-byte accounting remains exact. The
allocation-failure regression checks both raw-only and already-prepared row
layouts, then verifies a successful retry. Seven focused native gather and
quantized-row tests passed without skips or leaks. This removes
observed unnecessary work; it does not establish the exact cause of the CI timeout.

The regression loop now selects the inference project's environment for
inference selectors and preserves complete server output beside its reports.
Full inference CI also uploads those logs, rather than relying on a short
failure tail. GLiNER span extraction's multi-text contract is independent of
the boundary extractor's qualified singleton contract; the span registration
now accepts multi-text requests again while boundary limits remain enforced.


Validation used the repository's `zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh` for the HA
selector: two workers, three repetitions, six passed invocations with no skips,
errors, or failures. The CPU inference sequence used `run_e2e_case.py` to
supervise two independent pytest sessions, each containing all five dictate
cases, the three failing embedding cases, and the resolver extraction case.
All 18 invocations passed with no skips, errors, or failures; retained logs
confirm native CPU selection. Each session used a one-model limit and CI's
300-second request deadline. The soak binary contained the HA and inference
fixes; later import-only coordination changes were validated separately.
These runs do not reproduce the original 600-second CI timeout or prove a
before/after latency improvement: the earlier baseline binary was a different
build configuration.


## 2026-09-25: schema rewrite reply-loss recovery retries under leader churn

[PR #882's recovery-0 job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36173392068/job/108211921323)
failed `test_schema_rewrite_recovers_dependency_cohort[publication-reply_loss]`:
after 180 seconds the restore was still running at attempt 9, with zero of two
tables published and `GroupLeaderUnavailable` during the rewrite tail. Two
metadata nodes reported `metadata leader unavailable`. Retained metadata logs
showed individual WAL syncs taking 0.5–1.5 seconds, even for small records.
Those syncs explain some delayed Raft rounds, but the logs do not prove why
the data-group leader remained unavailable or that storage was the only cause.

The rewrite worker previously classified `GroupLeaderUnavailable` as a generic
execution failure. Each transient route gap durably requeued a new job attempt,
adding metadata consensus writes and eventually multi-second exponential
backoff during the same outage. Source reads are observations; routed source
writes distinguish non-proposal from unknown outcomes, and rewrite work resumes
from durable source and target receipts. The worker now treats a route gap as a
bounded continuation of the same attempt. Unknown write outcomes retain their
distinct classification. Neither Raft durability nor the test deadline changes.

The unchanged server passed 2/2 local reproductions on two workers; it did not
reproduce the CI leadership stall. The focused Zig rewrite suite passes all
three tests, including the retry classification regression. The first post-fix
two-worker, two-repetition loop passed 3/4. The fourth run reached the rewrite's
validating phase before data-4 exited with `ReadFailed` from background store
report collection. Metadata still had a stable term-1 leader and all three
snapshot probes succeeded. This is a distinct failure, not evidence that the
leader-gap continuation failed.

Background inventory collection and publication read local owner state and
remote metadata. A failed collection publishes no partial report, marks status
dirty, and retries from a fresh snapshot. Propagating its `ReadFailed` to the
control supervisor needlessly removes a data voter. The store-report error
handler now keeps the process running for this read failure, like its existing transient storage
errors. A deterministic worker regression injects `ReadFailed`, checks that no
fatal error escapes and the dirty bit survives, then completes a fresh report.
Persistent read failures remain logged and keep the report dirty.

With both fixes, the same two-worker, two-repetition flake loop passed 4/4
executed cases (zero skips, errors, or failures). The focused data-runtime
report-worker regression passed, as did all 42 restore-job store tests and all
three rewrite-driver tests. The local soak exercises the full cohort rewrite
and reply loss but did not reproduce CI's prolonged metadata WAL latency; a clean
local result cannot establish that the underlying slow-sync availability
problem has been eliminated.

## 2026-09-24: recovery shard quorum stalls in run 36028793026

[The recovery-1 job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/36028793026/job/107754773721)
failed `online_fk_merge_preserves_shadow_claims_and_retained_references[snapshot-child_owner]`
during corpus setup and `schema_rewrite_recovers_dependency_cohort[publication-coordinator]`
during source preparation. Both retained data logs show a proposed entry one
index above the committed/applied index at the write timeout. One leader had
zero recorded send failures; the other had 2,335 send failures and 648 exhausted
retries across its served groups. Metadata repeatedly reported
`GroupLeaderUnavailable` for the data group, while one metadata node still
served the running restore job. Its Raft WAL also recorded individual syncs
lasting 0.3–4 seconds. These facts do not yet distinguish a follower WAL stall
from a backed-up peer sender or a separate group route problem.

The unchanged cases passed 8/8 on two local workers and two repetitions;
the first case took 4.6–5 minutes per worker in the first repetition, so it
does exercise a heavy path without reproducing the CI timeout.
Raft leader-wait diagnostics now include voter match/activity counts and the
async HTTP sender's pending/failure/queue-full counters. A recurrence can use
those bounded snapshots to decide whether to change transport scheduling or
persistence. The sender also coalesces obsolete queued context-free heartbeats
for the same peer and group set, so they cannot indefinitely fill a per-peer
FIFO ahead of append traffic while a slow request is in flight. Heartbeats
carrying read-index context, heartbeat responses, votes, append, and snapshots
are retained. This addresses a bounded-queue pressure mechanism but does not
prove it caused either CI stall; slow physical WAL sync remains a separate
possible cause. A timeout increase is not accepted as a fix.

## 2026-09-22: #846 restore staging and #856 standby failures

[Issue #846](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/846) recurred in
[run 35780419851](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35780419851):
the restore job stayed in `running` through attempt 15, with zero tables
published. The retained restore log reports `RestoreValidationPending` and
`StorageBusy` during `authority_or_owner` staging. This identifies a storage
admission retry, but does not prove which caller held the target owner.

The owner source's background maintenance took leases on *all* resident owners
for an entire round, including slow storage work on other tables. Publication
needs exclusive admission to the target owner; those unrelated leases can
exhaust its five-second drain. Maintenance now leases one owner at a time.
LSM candidate selection retains only an identity and re-leases the chosen
owner if it is still the same generation. A deterministic owner-source test
holds one owner's maintenance lease while publishing another owner. This
removes one cross-table source of `StorageBusy`; the CI failure was not
reproduced locally before the change.

[Issue #856](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/856) collects distinct
signatures, not one established cause. In the same run, two standby-startup
tests timed out at `capture_catalog()`: its request timeout was ten seconds,
while the server permits thirty seconds for capture preflight alone. Capture
now gets a sixty-second request budget without replaying an uncertain POST.
The catalog-authority test's write instead received the explicit
locally-committed/standby-ACK-pending 503. It now uses the existing one-write
reconciliation helper, requiring both standby apply and the primary's durable
ACK before proceeding. Other 503 responses remain failures.

The earlier relational-session failure has a separate retained server log:
`RaftBatchWriteOutcomeUnknown` during participant BEGIN, then
`TransactionBeginFailed`, followed by a permanent `409 decision conflict` on
the stable session ID. Stable-ID BEGIN is idempotent for the same timestamp and
participant set. An ambiguous BEGIN now leaves those records pending and asks
the session to retry the same ID. It no longer sends an abort solely because a
Raft reply was lost; actual aborted decisions still report a conflict.
Deterministic tests cover both coordinator and follower BEGIN outcome loss.

The baseline flake loop passed 16/16 targeted restore/standby cases on two
workers and two repetitions. After the first owner-lease change, the rebuilt
server passed 36/36 on three workers and three repetitions. A final loop with
the transaction change passed 24/24 across restore, standby, catalog authority,
relational sessions, and publication reply loss. These passes exercise the
paths but do not reproduce the CI pressure.

The publication-coordinator failure in run 35671650044 had a self-confirmed
successor leader on node 1, with node 3 reporting the same term. The test's
extra requirement for three consecutive successful status polls falsely
reported no successor under intermittent CI status reads. Both recovery
tests now accept the existing same-term quorum proof directly. The affected
publication-coordinator case passed 4/4 on two workers and two repetitions;
the mixed relational restore's native and portable crash cases passed 2/2;
the four quorum-discovery unit cases passed. The publication-reply-loss
failure in run 35780419851 had a healthy node-2 leader while its restore job
remained in validation; follower `metadata leader unavailable` responses were
symptoms rather than proof of lost leadership. The owner-lease fix removes a
cross-table storage admission blocker on that path, but this particular
validation stall has not been reproduced or isolated.

The progressive-index restart failure in run 35780419851 loaded zero HBC
vectors with projection checkpoint sequence 66 and 64 produced source items.
The status API nevertheless said `queryable=true`. Readiness now compares a
loaded dense generation with its publication count certificate, falling back
to the existing durable coverage proof for older checkpoints that have
produced sources. An empty new index remains serviceable; a previously
populated index with missing physical state cannot claim queryability.
Generic projection checkpointing also now persists index effects before
advancing HBC projection metadata; the prior order allowed a crash to leave
metadata ahead of its index. The restart test requires a fresh, advanced
*shard-level* checkpoint before stopping the process and includes the
pre-restart status in any future failure. This corrected test passed 6/6 on
two workers and 32/32 on four workers. The original physical-vector loss has
not been reproduced locally; the status and ordering fixes close two concrete
unsafe paths but do not prove the CI loss had no other cause.

## 2026-09-21: #842 donor readiness and concurrent restore observations

[Issue #842](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/842) failed the
`snapshot-owner` foreign-key merge recovery case because it treated stable
metadata leadership as proof that the donor group's asynchronous leader report
had arrived. The shared cluster helper now polls that specific group under one
absolute deadline, follows metadata leader changes, checks process liveness,
and retains the last observation on timeout. Both recovery hooks use it.
Deterministic tests cover absent/delayed reports, leader changes, deadline
exhaustion, and process failure. The affected production test passed 4/4 with
two workers and two repetitions using `zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh`. No fault
window, merge deadline, or data-integrity assertion changed.

[Full run 35641562828](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35641562828)
also reported a 404 from a concurrent restore observer. A point lookup can
resolve a physical table just before restore replaces the logical binding and
retires that table. On absence, validate the original catalog identity before
returning 404. A changed or temporarily unavailable binding returns a retryable
503; the request never silently follows a replacement table. Deterministic
HTTP coverage checks both missing-table and missing-document paths, unchanged,
replaced, and deleted bindings, and catalog unavailability.

The unchanged observer reproduced a separate 409 topology-change response in
one of six runs. Its retry classifier already defines that response as
retryable; the observer now invokes that classifier for both 409 and 503.
404s remain failures. The rebuilt Linux server passes all five extension cases
and this restore observer (6/6), without a diagnostic shim. Final native
separate-cache server qualification passes the same six tests plus the
controlled standby ACK-withholding case (7/7).

Linux extension crashes and the full-unit failures from
this run are recorded in [the runtime flake history](../FLAKES.md#2026-09-21-full-lane-cache-vopr-storage-and-extension-failures).

The standby-startup ACK-pending 503 from the later PR lane did not reproduce in
four unchanged runs (two workers, two repetitions). One successful round does
not promise that every subsequent ACK arrives within the two-second response
budget. The streaming/restart test now sends each write once and reconciles only
the explicit locally-committed, ACK-pending response through both standby apply
and the primary's recorded ACK within one 20-second observation budget. Document,
restart, and remote-durability assertions still run. Other 503s fail; no mutation
is retried. Deterministic tests require both observations for success and failure
paths. A real authenticated proxy withholds all write ACKs until the original
write returns the exact post-commit 503, then releases them. The reconciliation
case fails with the old write handling and passed 4/4 with the correction on
two workers and two repetitions, preserving all restart,
content, and remote-durability assertions. Production acknowledgement policy and
explicit outage-rejection tests remain unchanged; these changes do not claim to
establish the CI latency cause.

## 2026-09-21: online merge recovery exceeded phase deadlines in PR #832 CI

[Run 35633482490's recovery-1 job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35633482490/job/106465550834)
failed two `test_online_merge_recovers_after_owner_link_outage_and_crash` cases:
`release-reply_loss` did not reach its injected release window within 90 seconds,
and `snapshot-raft_quorum` did not finish source release after the injected outage.
The latter's final observation remained in online `freeze`. Nine other recovery
cases passed. The ordinary Antfly E2E lane passed 727 tests (five skipped),
including the catalog cases for #828 and #831. Recovery-0, inference, and VOPR
qualification also passed in the same run.

Retained metadata/data logs show slow persistence, repeated group-leader and
transport timeouts, and delayed merge phase progress. The first case eventually
logs the release phase during teardown. Native stacks include threads in
`fsync`, but lack enough symbols to identify a complete wait chain. These are
different signatures from the catalog reporter-readiness and five-second
read-budget failures documented below; the logs do not establish their root
cause or prove they are unrelated to the candidate. No recovery deadline or
assertion has been relaxed, and the trace-test registration correction does not
fix these failures.

Evidence is retained under `.benchmark-results/issue-828/` in the PR worktree:
`ci-832-recovery.log` and `ci-832-recovery-artifacts/`, including both failed
clusters' metadata/data logs and native stacks.

An unchanged native macOS ARM64 run passed 8/8 targeted cases (two workers,
two repetitions); the exact CI Linux binary passed both cases under local x86
emulation. Injecting an 800 ms delay into every eighth `fsync`/`fdatasync`,
starting 30 seconds after each server starts, reproduced both timeout assertions.
However, the second reproduction stalled in `snapshot`, not CI's `freeze`.
This is evidence of persistence sensitivity, not proof of the original wait chain.

The controller performed a receiver ReadIndex twice per effect and reacquired
the same metadata context before preparing it. It also required receiver
leadership during donor-only phases, and conflated an installed source fence
with drained transactions, reproposing durable `begin` while waiting for drain.
It now borrows one authenticated observation for each step, resolves/reads the
receiver only when needed, and waits on an already-installed fence. Metadata
authority is still revalidated immediately before every write; preparation and
apply retain exact scope/receipt checks. No RPC or E2E deadline was raised.

The 13 focused controller tests cover ownership through ambiguous replies,
lost effects/CAS replies, cancellation, drain waiting, and donor-only routing
without a receiver leader. All six owner-link/crash scenarios passed on two
native workers (12/12). Five proxy diagnostics/CLI tests pass. The same sustained
800 ms injection still times out after these changes: fewer reads do not make
arbitrary persistence stalls fit the existing budgets. Both failed runs remain
retained and must not be presented as passing pressure qualification or as a
reproduction of CI's exact freeze stall. Bounded proxy diagnostics now retain
receipt sequence, fence identity, drain status, and observation time.

Reproduction uses `scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh` with explicit selectors,
`SKIP_BUILD=1`, `ANTFLY_BIN`, `ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_WORKERS=2`, and a fresh
`ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPORT_DIR`. Local evidence is `merge-before*`,
`merge-linux-before*`, `merge-linux-pressure3*`, `merge-linux-pressure-fixed2*`,
and `merge-native-soak*` under the directory above. The Linux experiment used
four emulated CPUs and an 8 GiB container, not native ARC hardware.

## 2026-09-21: dependency-cohort seeding lost leadership after readiness (#841)

[Issue #841](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/841) links
[run 35647014305](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35647014305/job/106507526474):
the child-table seed in `test_schema_rewrite_recovers_dependency_cohort`
exhausted its 30-second write budget. The fixture already waits for all three
replicas, known leaders, and enforced constraints before seeding. The retained
logs show subsequent leader unavailability and activation `ConcurrencyUnavailable`;
they do not establish that a first election never completed.

Every data-node supervisor was scheduling activation and retirement against
the entire cluster catalog. Duplicate attempts are fenced by durable progress
CAS, but still consume remote reads, transaction slots, and persistence work.
Maintenance now samples current local group leadership before doing that work.
It yields if the Raft host mutex is busy, so maintenance does not queue behind
slow persistence merely to discover that it is a follower. Elections transfer
work on the next pass; native progress remains authoritative, and no completion
cache can hide a new schema generation. Standalone ownership is unchanged.

Deterministic regressions exercise follower suppression, leader transfer,
standalone behavior, and contention with the Raft host. The maintenance suite
also exposed a duplicated `expectErrorLogs(1)` declaration around one injected
session-store failure; remove the duplicate, preserving strict error accounting.
Before the ownership change, both #841 scenarios passed on two native workers
(4/4). Consequently, the original seed failure has not been reproduced locally;
the scheduling defect is independently established, not a proven explanation
for every `LeaderUnavailable` in that CI run. Seed budgets and mutation retry
rules are unchanged. Evidence: `ci-841-recovery.log`, `merge-native-soak*`, and
`activation-*` beside the merge evidence above.

## 2026-09-21: catalog reporter startup preceded protocol readiness

[Issue #828](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/828) records
[run 35549453714's catalog failure](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35549453714/job/106186967472).
`test_large_inventory_uses_bounded_control_and_diagnostic_transfers` failed at
synthetic reporter registration with HTTP 500 / `RuntimeStatusProtocolUnavailable`.
The retained diagnostics show leader node 2 with protocol ready/activated version
0 and one failed probe, while followers report ready version 17. HTTP readiness
and ordinary data-node registration therefore did not establish the leader's
ability to persist the synthetic reporter's required dense-native status profile.
The probe also checks incarnation compatibility; a peer advertising version 17
alone does not prove readiness. The evidence does not establish an activation
state-machine defect.

[Issue #831](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/issues/831) also reports this
signature in [PR #793's catalog job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35564629013/job/106229248643),
where `test_report_baseline_fragments_large_group_and_batches_neighbors` fails
registration on all three metadata endpoints with the same protocol error and
deferred activation probe. The shared fixture barrier covers both tests.

The other main-run occurrence linked from #831 has a different signature.
[Job 106215258019](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35557807565/job/106215258019)
fails `test_skewed_schema_migrations_keep_foreground_traffic_available` on a
foreground batch write with HTTP 503 / `DeadlineExceeded` after 5,003 ms, after
setup succeeds. Metadata logs include a WAL commit lasting 6,457 ms; the trace
does not identify the write's exact wait or establish the timeout's root cause.
Do not classify this failure as protocol readiness merely because the startup
log also contains `MetadataIncarnationUnavailable`. This full-E2E job retained
only its executable artifact. It now preserves failed cluster roots and uploads
server logs, diagnostic snapshots, and native stacks, like the base-E2E job.
Original job logs are `issue-831-pr793.log` and `issue-831-main.log` beside the
#828 evidence below.

The read-budget audit found a distinct defect that can explain an early
five-second failure: write validation establishes the existing 12-second metadata
snapshot allowance, but `readSystemCatalog` truncated the entire operation to
the five-second forwarding-envelope limit for one RPC. A deterministic VoprIo
regression lets the first peer consume its five-second allowance, then makes the
next peer recover 1.4 seconds later. On unchanged main's read implementation,
it fails with `DeadlineExceeded` before trying the recovered peer, despite time
remaining in the caller's budget (`issue-831-budget-negative.log`).

Catalog reads now keep one absolute deadline from the caller, capped by the
existing snapshot allowance, and cap each individual RPC at the unchanged
five-second wire limit. Retry backoff consumes that same deadline. Shorter
deadlines and cancellation remain authoritative, including after a response
arrives. Mutations do not gain retries. The regression also covers complete
budget exhaustion and rejects late or canceled successful responses. This
establishes and fixes premature read-budget exhaustion; the retained CI log
alone cannot prove that this was its exact internal failure path.
All seven focused catalog read/cache/failover regressions pass without leaks.
The final Debug server, including the budget correction, passes all 19 catalog
and readiness cases with the normal four-worker runner. Its SHA-256 is
`e77cf5b0c7139a6f7a53a817a4c052c8081a51a4e8d4302585b0495f8aa3fedd`;
see `issue-831-budget-fixed.log` and `catalog-with-budget-module.log`.
The targeted #831 soak then passes 40/40 fresh-server cases: two workers, five
repetitions each of reporter baseline fragmentation and foreground migration
traffic, under both normal and 256-FD profiles. There are no errors or skips;
write deadlines and every availability/count assertion are unchanged. Reports
and logs are in `issue-831-soak/` and `issue-831-soak.log`. This is native macOS
ARM64 qualification; it does not substitute for native Linux ARC CI.

Inspection of `origin/main` at `a032858819bd89ffcb31e5dcf7e76699babfdc3b`
confirmed the missing fixture barrier and the HTTP 500 classification. An
unchanged macOS ARM64 Debug binary passed one isolated case and twelve cases
across four independent workers; the original HTTP 500 did not recur naturally.
A deterministic fixture regression supplies an unready leader followed by a
ready one: the original fixture yields immediately and fails the assertion;
the corrected fixture waits before exposing the cluster.

Catalog setup now observes a leader with a metadata incarnation and the named
V17 ready profile, with a bounded deadline and retained setup-failure diagnostics.
It does not require activation to have already committed: the subsequent
registration can commit it. Unknown future version numbers do not satisfy the
profile by numeric ordering. Status-read connection failures and HTTP 503 can be
polled; HTTP 500 propagates. Reporter writes, inventory assertions, transfer
admission assertions, and their deadlines are unchanged. Production node
mutation responses classify unavailable protocol as HTTP 503, without claiming
whole-request non-admission: node registration may have committed before store
admission fails.

The catalog fixture was also missing its process-resource declaration. The normal
four-worker runner classified these six-node clusters as lightweight and bypassed
the two-process-slot limit. The fixture now declares `antfly_process` using the
existing scheduler API. Eleven readiness regressions, 62 scheduler tests, and the
focused Zig HTTP-classification regression pass. The final complete catalog and
readiness modules pass all 19 tests with four pytest workers and two process slots.

Retain the unsuccessful stress runs too. An earlier four-worker catalog soak
passed 39/40 cases (20/20 normal, 19/20 at `nofile=256`); its failure was a later
diagnostic snapshot admission returning `snapshot transfer capacity exhausted`,
after reporter registration succeeded. While that soak and TLA/build work ran,
the broader catalog module passed 16/18 cases: a data-node `ReadFailed` after
deliberate leader termination and a full-text count of 2001 instead of 2002 were
the failures. The unchanged binary subsequently passed those two cases, which
does not establish that these failures are unrelated or pre-existing. The final
module pass after resource classification does not prove their runtime causes.
A subsequent two-worker soak passed 20/20 fresh-server cases: five per worker
under each of the normal and 256-FD profiles, with no failures or skips. Its
reports are in `final-soak/` and `catalog-final-soak.log` beside the failed runs.

During qualification, main advanced to `227f2dc39c` (#784), which independently
added the same catalog process-resource declaration. Rebase preserves that
upstream change; trace ownership and the readiness barrier were still unfixed.
All 77 readiness/scheduler regressions pass on that base.
The rebuilt Debug server also passes all 19 catalog/readiness cases through the
normal four-worker runner, two isolated large-inventory repetitions, and eight
two-worker inventory cases across normal and 256-FD profiles. Its SHA-256 is
`baad0214e7c0e07f4f3d1de88e8f9f8e59d216b744ee24adebf6756c21e6487b`;
results are `catalog-rebased-*.log`, `rebased-serial/`, and `rebased-soak/`.
These checks precede the separate catalog-read deadline correction for #831.

Evidence is in `.benchmark-results/issue-828/` in `.worktrees/issue-828-flakes`:
`catalog-readiness-negative.log`, `catalog-fixed-soak.log`, `fixed-soak/`,
`catalog-fixed-module.log`, `catalog-baseline-extra.log`, and
`catalog-fixed-final-module.log`, with JUnit reports and preserved failure roots.
The fixed native Debug server SHA-256 is
`5b1b38811386f099ffc7aae7815ed1a15a6a2671997e5e9f088b9e121ac8a331`;
the unchanged server is
`9e22dada7c087f6bda5726c6846494098498d2a2ba5e2d122e010b933476d6a5`.
Native Linux ARC qualification remains a CI gate.

Reproduce with `scripts/ci/zig-e2e-catalog-soak.sh`, `SKIP_BUILD=1`, an absolute
`ANTFLY_BIN`, and a fresh absolute `ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPORT_DIR`. It runs both
normal and 256-FD profiles; worker and repeat counts use
`ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_WORKERS` and `ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPEATS`. Use the normal
`scripts/ci/zig-antfly-e2e-pytest.sh` runner for module-level parallel scheduling.
The catalog soak also accepts explicit pytest selectors; its no-argument default
is unchanged. For #831, pass
`e2e/antfly/test_catalog_resilience.py::test_report_baseline_fragments_large_group_and_batches_neighbors`
and
`e2e/antfly/test_catalog_resilience.py::test_skewed_schema_migrations_keep_foreground_traffic_available`.

## 2026-09-18: concurrent aggregations stalled hydration and raced primary generations

[Run 35304355356, Antfly E2E](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35304355356/job/105482406606)
failed `test_aggregations_remain_exact_during_concurrent_inserts` in its read-only
phase: all ten readers exceeded the unchanged 15-second request deadline.
The workflow ran from `20fb9f572a`, but checked out candidate
`3136b34eb0fc08749a91da6f8c465dbd5d5c425c` (storage-performance follow-up).
The exact Linux artifact reproduced the failure. Fresh `origin/main` builds at
`20fb9f572a` reproduced it on both native macOS ARM64 and Linux x86 under emulation,
so it is not specific to that candidate's storage changes.

Initial count searches completed in about 56 ms. The full-result aggregation
rerun hydrated each text hit through a separate primary probe. Native stack
samples caught readers busy-spinning in `DocStore.lockPayloadPolicy`, with its
holder waiting for the LSM backend lock. The payload-policy lock covers primary
view and payload-session capture; an unbounded spin there consumes the CPUs
needed by publication/reclamation and amplifies thousands of per-hit probes.
An isolated single-reader run completed 16 queries in its read phase.

Payload-policy contention now uses the existing bounded-spin/yield primitive.
Text hydration uses the same projected batch loader as match-all, retaining the
selected hit order, existing stored rows, projection fields, missing-row errors,
and request deadline. Regression coverage includes allocation-failure cleanup,
malformed batch cardinality, missing rows, and admission after deadline expiry.
The focused DB query suite passes 205 tests with two skips and no leaks.
The E2E phase always performs the required two reads per worker; its five-second
window adds contention without imposing a machine-dependent throughput floor.
The 15-second request deadline and every exact aggregation assertion remain.

With batched hydration, the Linux ReleaseFast executable passed the original
concurrency case in 24 seconds: each reader completed 19–33 queries during the
five-second read-only phase, followed by three successful concurrent-write
phases. A two-worker soak then passed 40/40 cases across normal and 256-FD
profiles: ten aggregation and ten savepoint commits per profile, with no skips.
These Linux x86 executions used local container emulation, not native ARC.
The macOS ARM64 ReleaseSafe build, including yielding payload-policy
admission, passed all 23 aggregation and transaction E2E cases. Its ten readers
each completed 41–42 queries in the read-only phase; all concurrent-write
phases retained exact results.

A subsequent native two-worker soak passed 39/40 cases: one concurrent-write
phase returned HTTP 409 after 24 `IdentityReadGenerationChanged` retries.
Inspection found a post-capture race: the full-result path consulted current
DB generation after capturing all stored rows, so continuous writes could
invalidate every completed search. Reruns now use the same captured-row context
as the first-search fast path: if generation has advanced, they aggregate the
immutable rows without mixing in newer index acceleration state. Incomplete
captures and requests that require unavailable index context remain rejected.
A deterministic regression updates a captured document and inserts another
before aggregation, requiring the original count and values.

That correction alone passed 37/40 native soak cases, with three remaining
generation-change 409s in the constrained profile. Selection and the full-result
rerun still released writer admission between searches. Local aggregations now
own one DB read lease through selection, rerun, and aggregation. Raft read safety
is established before acquiring that lease; reruns use it directly and must not
wait on an apply barrier while holding it. The lease is released before public
post-processing and encoding. A deterministic regression checks writer exclusion
between phases, a single pre-lease Raft barrier, exact aggregation results, and
successful mutation after release. Distributed cross-shard generation fencing
is unchanged. All 85 table-read contract tests pass without failures or leaks,
including both new regressions and the existing stale-generation rejection test.

The legacy-adapter lease build passed another 40/40 native repetitions, but a
route audit showed that linked production queries still crossed the storage ABI
between selection and collection. That pass did not qualify lease ownership on
the production path. Ordinary single-shard aggregations now finalize inside the
physical local-query provider using the same lease and shared collection/budget
rules. An explicit raw-result execution option keeps aggregation specifications
on shard searches (where they also control exact candidate totals) while leaving
finalization to the coordinator. The option uses a reserved byte without changing
the ABI layout. Reranking, pruning, and cross-table aggregation remain
coordinator-owned.
Routing coverage requires one complete local-owner call, and a provider-ABI
regression uses the production storage-request encoder, checks exact aggregates
over all matches while preserving both zero- and one-hit pages, and verifies raw
shard responses omit final aggregates. The storage encoder preserves aggregation
specifications; generic inter-node forwarding keeps coordinator finalization. No
lease or storage internals cross the ABI.
The final linked table-read suite passes all 88 tests (17 implementation and
71 consumer contracts), with no failures or leaks.

The linked macOS ARM64 ReleaseSafe production executable with provider
finalization and request serialization passed all 25 aggregation/transaction
E2Es, including the new one- and three-shard page-limit checks and existing
aggregation budget rejection. Its two-worker soak passed 40/40 fresh-server
cases: ten aggregation and ten savepoint cases per normal and 256-FD profile,
with no failures, errors, or skips. The executable SHA-256 is
`8e8e152fb83a39fe93ce3ddb609df818705227e9d079981f3215aedf2b467fec`.

The final Linux x86_64 Debug executable also passed all 25 aggregation/transaction
E2Es under local container emulation, including all concurrent-write phases with
the unchanged request deadline. Its SHA-256 is
`72c5cd8eacc4ca783741ff62af869ca6e4db3a226e84470d63bf16a4b3547b22`.
This is additional architecture coverage, not native ARC qualification.

Before publishing, merge `origin/main` at `addc7fa2ca` (#790). Its concurrent
aggregation fixture independently switched to two barrier-synchronized rounds
and the ordinary 30-second public request timeout. Preserve that upstream fixture
behavior alongside the new page-limit regression. The results above precede this
merge and used the original 15-second request deadline; the production fixes do
not depend on the upstream timeout increase.

## 2026-09-18: stable transaction recovery overlapped foreground execution

The same job failed `test_session_transform_savepoint_rollback` with HTTP 503,
`transaction coordinator is temporarily unavailable`. That response covers begin
failure and a non-durable abort; the original server log did not identify which
internal outcome occurred.

Inspection exposed a concrete race: publishing `commit_execution_started` adds
recoverable work before foreground 2PC completes. Maintenance could replay that
same transaction immediately, including during the terminal-response/coordinator
acknowledgement gap. Durable record mutation locks do not serialize this execution.
Local execution ownership now spans commit validation through the durable handoff;
maintenance skips occupied execution stripes and leaves recovery indexed for the
next pass. HTTP retries wait through their own cancellable I/O authority.
The durable owner lease still fences cross-node adoption, and restart loses only
in-memory execution ownership, preserving the existing crash-recovery path.

A deterministic regression invokes maintenance from inside both foreground commit
and acknowledgement. Another forces cancellation and handoff through caller I/O.
All 22 session maintenance tests and all 21 production transaction E2E tests pass.
The original intermittent 503 was not independently reproduced; the forced
interleaving establishes the corrected race without attributing an unrecorded
internal error to the original run.

`scripts/ci/zig-e2e-query-transaction-soak.sh` repeats both cases in the VOPR
workflow's native production lane: 50 executions of each case per normal and
256-FD profile. The evidence gate requires all 200 reports and rejects skips.
This native contention coverage complements the deterministic transaction
interleaving; it does not claim an exact-replay VOPR history for a CPU starvation
failure.

## 2026-09-17: large catalog mutation failed during fast native elections

[Run 35298670343's Antfly E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35298670343/job/105470606625)
failed only `test_large_inventory_uses_bounded_control_and_diagnostic_transfers`:
creating database `large_8` returned HTTP 503. The control/diagnostic byte bounds,
10,000-group inventory, isolated capture admission, and table create/delete had
already passed. The job tested candidate `d9c4ef1f939d7f615cf95b235b08deef675f720c`;
the workflow run's head SHA is a different ref. This is distinct from the earlier
restore failures below. Its retained cluster root is `antfly-zig-scaling-e2e-c0fz2o1t`.

Metadata logs show repeated elections and real WAL commits taking more than one
second, including a 1,632 ms commit. The shared scaling fixture forced 25 ms Raft
and control ticks. Catalog resilience now opts into the executable's production
cadence, as the restore fixture already does; other scaling callers keep their
existing cadence. Mutation failures retain status, body, and response headers.
The original exception discarded the response body, so its precise 503 error
identity and admission outcome remain unknown. No failed mutation is retried,
and the catalog size, page bounds, admission isolation, writes, and process
liveness assertions remain required.

The original Linux CI executable passed one baseline repetition with 25 ms ticks.
With production cadence it passed all eight catalog resilience cases, followed
by 20 fresh-cluster repetitions of the failing case using two workers: ten normal
and ten under a 256-descriptor limit. Every JUnit case passed without skips or
errors. These are Linux x86_64 executions under local container emulation; they
do not establish reproduction of the original HTTP 503 or qualification on ARC.

`scripts/ci/zig-e2e-catalog-soak.sh` now runs in the scheduled VOPR workflow's
production E2E job: 50 cases per descriptor profile, 100 total. Exact cohort
counts, binary digest, and failed-root retention remain required. This native
large-inventory/disk/scheduler stress complements deterministic VOPR; no new
replay scenario is claimed without an identified production defect and a
deterministic failing regression.

## 2026-09-17: stalled-discovery restore poll and production-soak leadership churn

[PR #781's E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35247545305/job/105310030026)
failed `test_backup_restore_discovers_leader_past_stalled_status` while polling
restore job `7733568408289635401`: HTTP 500 with `INTERNAL_ERROR`. Its artifact
pattern omitted metadata-backup fixture roots, and that ephemeral runner's logs
are no longer available. The exact handler error for this request is unproven.
The unchanged CI executable passed 10 serial and 50 two-worker Linux repetitions;
20 local macOS repetitions also passed. Passing repeats do not establish a cause.

The concurrently running [production soak](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35247508165/job/105291344795)
provided retained evidence of proposal supersession/apply timeout, metadata
leadership churn, and incomplete restores. See [the runtime record](../FLAKES.md#2026-09-17-restore-leadership-recovery-lost-proposal-error-identity)
for the stable error-transport and scoped recovery fixes. The native fixture now
uses production clock settings; its former 5 ms ticks gave real disk syncs longer
than the election budget. Completion deadlines, exact restored-content checks,
and failure-on-500 behavior remain unchanged.

Both backup/restore variants now run in the scheduled normal and 256-descriptor
profiles: 50 repetitions per variant per profile, 200 cases total. Evidence checks
require all four cohorts and reject failed, missing, or skipped cases. Standard
E2E CI uploads metadata-backup server logs and failure diagnostics. A failed job
poll also includes fresh metadata observations and server log tails in its JUnit
failure, so a future error remains diagnosable even if artifact collection fails.

A bounded Linux check using the unchanged CI executable and corrected native
cadence passed 40/40 cases: ten per variant per profile. That isolates the fixture
change; it does not validate the new production recovery code. An additional
20-case concurrent-poll probe passed, with no reproduction of the original 500.
The rebuilt macOS ARM64 executable containing the production restore-recovery
changes passed another 20/20 serial cases (five per variant per profile), with
no failures, errors, or skips. This precedes the later status-publication deadline
change. Both variants also pass a final two-case smoke on the executable containing
the publication and separate schema-progress budgets. Final Linux CI and the
complete scheduled soak remain required.

## 2026-09-16: 3x3 backup/delete/restore admission stall

`test_three_by_three_cluster_backup_restore_through_metadata_public_api` timed out
waiting for restore job `3531487279743073036` in
[PR #771's E2E job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35163796459/job/105028671150).
A local two-worker, 20-case baseline reproduced the stall: an owner opened before
import pinned an empty generation and indefinitely blocked Raft restore bootstrap.
See [the runtime flake record](../FLAKES.md#2026-09-16-3x3-restore-owner-admission-blocked-its-own-bootstrap)
for evidence, the compiled-owner regression, and production admission fix.

Scheduled VOPR qualification now runs the seeded admission histories; the production
soak runs this E2E and its stalled-discovery variant 50 times each with normal
limits and 50 times each with 256 descriptors.
The test preserves one restore idempotency key across uncertain admission, accepts
documented committed or uncertain delete outcomes only after observing catalog
absence, and retains the original 120-second completion assertion. An uncertain
seed batch is never replayed and must converge to every expected document's exact
payload within its existing budget. Unresolved or partial outcomes still fail. Timeout diagnostics include fresh metadata and observed jobs.
Run profiles sequentially at the scheduled two-cluster limit: a four-cluster local
experiment exhausted TCP ports. Its fatal generic HTTP write error also led to a
deterministic socket-reset regression and transport-identity fix; see the runtime
record for the failed experiment and its limits.
The merged executable also exposed a redundant topology-probe failure after a
successful restore and replication check. The check now returns the same agreed
table/group identities it validated across all metadata nodes, removing the second
optional read while retaining the incarnation and per-data-node content checks.
A later two-worker macOS run also exhausted local TCP ports (51,921 `TIME_WAIT`
sockets and explicit `EADDRNOTAVAIL` before restore). For the current 200-case
local run on macOS (both variants and profiles), set `ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_WORKERS=1` and
`ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPEATS=50`; the scheduled Linux job keeps two workers.
Neither uncertain mutation failures nor host resource exhaustion count as passes.
Final macOS ARM64 ReleaseSafe validation passed 100/100 serial cases (50 normal,
50 constrained), with complete JUnit evidence and an unchanged executable hash.
The deterministic admission histories and all 110 harness/script checks also pass.
Linux parallel qualification remains separate from this local result.

## 2026-09-16: constrained Autograph restart exited during teardown

The [second PR #704 production soak](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/35126679231/job/104951437450)
failed `test_multinode_autograph_recovers_after_data_restart` at constrained
worker 2, iteration 16: node 102 exited with `StorageBusy` during committed Raft
apply. The same root logged lost `DistributedQueryUnavailable` error identity.
The test body passed; the teardown assertion correctly caught the failed process.
The workflow's `tee` pipeline hid the script failure until JUnit verification.
See [the runtime investigation](../FLAKES.md#2026-09-16-constrained-autograph-restart-lost-retryable-owner-admission)
for the admission/replay fix, error transport, and deterministic regressions.

## 2026-09-15: Autograph promotion and read-timeout boundary

The first corrected local executable still failed 3/10 data-restart cases and
exposed a promotion callback using a freed Raft service during shutdown. The
compiled-owner shutdown barrier and resolver activation ordering are corrected.
Revision `256bb99782` passed ten restart probes and the full local 200-case
Autograph soak: 100 normal and 100 descriptor-limited cases, with 50 ordinary
and 50 restart cases per profile, zero failures/errors/skips, and an unchanged
executable hash. This result precedes the subsequent apply-lock handoff fix;
Linux CI and full VOPR qualification must validate the final revision. The restart test now rejects
spontaneous assertion/segmentation crashes instead of silently replacing the
process. See `../FLAKES.md` for exact executable hashes and evidence.

`test_resolution.py::test_multinode_autograph_resolves_promotes_and_hydrates_entities`
failed in [run 34928784180](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34928784180/job/104259435053)
with missing promoted entities and an HTTP 500 caused by an untransportable
`ReadIndexTimeout`. See [the runtime investigation](../FLAKES.md#2026-09-15-multi-node-autograph-promotion-stalls-with-an-untransportable-read-timeout)
for the exact revision, retained journal evidence, and deterministic reopen fix.
The merged-main production binary reproduced two failures in 100 local cases:
pending promotion at journal sequence 3 was absent from the reopened runtime's
target of 2. A later 50/50 pass does not invalidate those failures.
The poller now rejects unexpected 500s immediately. The scheduled production
soak runs 50 normal and 50 constrained-descriptor repetitions of each of the
original case and `test_multinode_autograph_recovers_after_data_restart`, using
`scripts/ci/zig-e2e-autograph-soak.sh`, with exact JUnit counts and retained native
failure diagnostics (GDB on Linux, `sample` on macOS). The restart case exposed
an additional untransportable `AddressUnavailable`; known read-transport failures
now preserve the existing retryable read-availability contract. A passing helper
or deterministic test does not qualify the post-fix production soak.


## 2026-09-13: artifact coverage restart failure reproduced locally (#722)

[CI run 34789270919, job 103815319126](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34789270919/job/103815319126?pr=722)
reported three failures, 443 passes, and five skips on `87da3ef6d4`:

- `test_table_chunker_full_text_index_routes_template_chunks[stateful]` returned
  HTTP 500 with `RuntimeBoundaryFailure` while querying the enabled full-text index.
- `test_artifact_coverage_terminal_outcomes_by_policy_after_restart` exhausted
  its existing 90-second wait after restart; the partial-policy index reported
  `runtime_unavailable` and `missing_group`.
- `test_semantic_timeout_budget_survives_embedding_cache` returned an unexpected
  HTTP 504 in the positive query-budget loop.

[The rerun job](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/actions/runs/34789270919/job/103820209296)
reported **one failure, 445 passes, five skips**: only the same partial-policy
artifact restart failure recurred. The other two scenarios passed that attempt.

The unchanged PR revision was built locally in native macOS arm64 Debug.
Executable SHA-256:
`289c0bf27f8a13dabd35f138414bad784daf3062df2c42f3c24c6893cbec77b9`.
Python was 3.12.11. Each scenario passed three serial repetitions and 30
concurrent repetitions (three workers, ten iterations each): **33/33 per
scenario**, with no failures or skips. The three containing modules then passed
**54/54** using the CI scheduler settings of four pytest workers and two Antfly
process slots, including the shared module fixture used by the full-text case.
Assertions, deadlines, and test implementations were unchanged; no failed-case
retries were added. Failure-root preservation and native diagnostics were enabled.

A fresh batch on the same executable ran **100 repetitions per scenario**
(four workers, 25 iterations each). Full-text routing passed **100/100** and
semantic deadlines passed **100/100**; artifact restart passed **99/100**.
Worker 1, iteration 3 reproduced the CI signature after restart: the
partial-policy index had `runtime_present=false`, `runtime_fresh=false`,
one expected group, zero reported groups, and one missing group. Its coverage
reasons were exactly `runtime_unavailable` and `missing_group`, and the
unchanged 90-second wait expired. The earlier 33/33 batch did not expose this
failure; its passes are not combined with this fresh batch.

Complete batch output is `/tmp/pr722-local-100.log`. Worker logs are preserved
under `/var/folders/4d/kpjq2k9s0290tgwy5n3rwxxr0000gn/T/antfly-e2e-regression.DDj7Pl`.
The failed database and server log are archived in
`/tmp/pr722-artifact-restart-failure.tar.gz`, SHA-256

Use workers=4 and repeats=25 in the command below to reproduce this batch shape.

The unchanged base commit `c1a39a3aeb65e62d9e4494c5b785a028e4520c5d` then
passed **100/100 in all three scenarios** under the same native Debug workload,
using the identical PR test harness and changing only `ANTFLY_BIN` to the base
executable. Its SHA-256 is
`60b322cf0d40bc18352ce9850d63d8f5250a23e8e9d4d108f39f4342d7be2b37`.
The base checkout is `.worktrees/maintenance-base-repro`; complete output is
`/tmp/pr722-base-100.log`. Machine-checked counts and binary identities are in
`/tmp/pr722-100-run-comparison.json`. These are separate batches, with no skipped
tests or failed-case retries. One PR failure versus zero base failures in these
samples does not establish causation or show the base is free of the race.

From the worktree root, after building `zig-out/bin/antfly` under `zig/`:

```sh

```

Evidence: `/tmp/pr722-latest-failure.log`, `/tmp/pr722-local-e2e-build.log`,
`/tmp/pr722-local-serial.log`, `/tmp/pr722-local-concurrent.log`, and
`/tmp/pr722-local-modules.log`. CI used Linux x86_64 ReleaseFast with eight-CPU
affinity and the complete Antfly base suite. The native artifact-restart failure
matches its observed CI signature, but the two other failures remain unreproduced.
These runs do not yet establish whether the failures predate the PR.
The subsequent follow-up is tracked in [Zig runtime flakes](../FLAKES.md),
including the overlapping #626 failures, deterministic ownership/publication
and text-planning regressions, and separate before/after validation batches.
The retained native failure is evidence for that investigation; the original
full-text and deadline signatures have not been reproduced locally.

## 2026-09-11: stale expiry and uncertain capacity found in fresh review (#694)

Two deterministic regressions failed on `8a4d2d83e`: a delayed expired-job
poll deleted a replacement after an unknown admission receipt, and a full
retained-byte budget still allowed durable admission. The fix invalidates
stale observations before persistence, conditionally deletes only the observed
durable record, and reserves admission/update capacity through unknown outcomes.
See `../FLAKES.md` for the proof, protocol/ABI changes, and regression coverage.

Focused native Debug validation passed 29 restore-store, 248 metadata-logic,
and 36 restore HTTP tests with no skips, failures, or leaks. Fresh 100/100
acceptance per E2E scenario remains pending on a rebuilt revision.

The native Debug soak starting 2026-09-11 17:01:24 UTC uses `8a4d2d83e`
(binary SHA-256 `9d65a426a0e64b37687220f146b5d3d99f63322ed475162d79f34f4a024707f4`).
Those results are historical; these fixes require another rebuilt binary.
Short-lived E2E scenarios do not replace the expiry and capacity regressions.

## 2026-09-11: expired restore key reuse found during soak review (#694)

Review of `0126d8b30` found a seven-day expiry case outside the short-lived E2E
scenarios: polling forgot the local job without deleting its durable key, so
conditional re-admission returned expired history and never queued a restore.
The deterministic regression passes with main's restore-store implementation
and fails on that PR revision. Expiry now confirms durable retirement before
releasing local ownership, and admission recovers expired records left behind
by older caches. Fault regressions cover deletion failure, unknown deletion
outcomes, leadership loss, and exactly-once requeue after recovery. See
`../FLAKES.md` for evidence and the focused Debug command.

The native Debug soak started at 2026-09-11 16:31:39 UTC uses `0126d8b30`.
Its results are historical for this fix; fresh acceptance must use a rebuilt
binary. Issue #705's separate heap-corruption failure remains unresolved.

## 2026-09-11: restore admission recovery and range cleanup (#694)

The second retained `0259bab66` metadata backup failure contains two jobs for
the same restore fingerprint, with distinct generated keys. The first job had
published the destination; the second failed `TableAlreadyExists`. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/ci694-main-review-second-failure.tar.gz`, SHA-256
`3cb2de630eff6dde0c17e3015c9f5f30b08072e063141cbfa3235dfec23e3842`.
The receipt fix prevents the observed leadership error from being mislabeled
as safe to replay. Conditional restore admission now additionally preserves a
recoverable identity across an unresolved timeout; retrying that same key
cannot overwrite the original job or create another one. Do not blindly retry
an unknown outcome without the returned key, or treat a missing job as proof
that the enqueue cannot still commit.

Review also replaced per-completion table-wide progress scans with an atomic
range/node index and versioned rebuild. See [runtime regressions](../FLAKES.md)
for the deterministic admission and bounded-work coverage. These changes need
a new final-revision 100/100 soak; prior acceptance counts are historical.
The independent #705 heap corruption remains under investigation.

## 2026-09-11: merged soak exposes a superseded create receipt (#694)

The fresh `0259bab66` Linux batch failed an initial backup-table create with an
unknown-outcome 409 after metadata leadership loss. Durable logs retain the
common prefix and its replacement no-op, with no create. The failed root and
worker log are preserved in `/private/tmp/ci694-main-review-first-failure.tar.gz`
(SHA-256 `8893cda56544fb8af67124724cd730cb42c56900b46c4bbcec23021d4ca1eda9`).

The production fix waits for the receipt's actual applied identity and exposes
a distinct non-application proof only for a superseded single atomic topology
command. Routing can then retry within its existing budgets. It does not replay
unknown outcomes or change the fixture's assertions, cadence, or deadlines.
See `zig/FLAKES.md` for the proof, protocol compatibility, and validation details.
A new complete 100-per-scenario batch is required after this correction.

## 2026-09-11: fresh review before the merged Linux soak (#694)

The fresh review additionally reproduced mixed-version Raft catch-up stalling:
released followers report their last index in rejection fields that the new
leader interpreted as a request index. Compatibility handling now preserves the
confirmed prefix and coalesces ambiguous pipeline failures into heartbeat-paced
recovery. Its deterministic before/after regression and 403-test Raft suite
pass, as do 100 stable etcd differential seeds. See `zig/FLAKES.md` for details.
The new mixed Linux soak remains pending until the corrected binary is built;
the pre-merge acceptance below does not validate this revision.

## 2026-09-11: main merge and peer endpoint review follow-up (#694)

The main merge preserves the regression targets in the new build modules.
Review reproduced a peer endpoint change being ignored while placement stayed
unchanged; the fix now includes owned node IDs and Raft URLs in the cache
inputs without invalidating on heartbeat telemetry. The merged data-runtime
suite passes 179/179 and Python harness checks pass 73/73. See `../FLAKES.md`
for the deterministic before/after evidence. Fresh 100-per-scenario Linux
acceptance is required; the 300/300 result below belongs to the pre-merge code.

## 2026-09-11: mixed Linux acceptance before the main merge (#694)

The fresh run completed **300/300**, with **100/100 each** for CLI quickstart,
three-by-three metadata backup/restore, and CLI retry exhaustion/restart.
Four workers each ran 25 iterations of all three scenarios, from 02:21:01 to
03:17:04 UTC. There were zero failures, errors, skips, or failed-case retries;
the driver exited 0. These results are from one revision and do not combine
passes from the earlier failed runs.

Production commit `05f96814e` includes the atomic coverage batch, lifecycle and
placement authority fixes, durable Raft replacement/abort fixes, and monotonic
replication progress. Test revision `b63468094` includes complete publication
before exact semantic ranking. The subsequent `574af3586` formatter correction
has an identical Python AST. The Linux x86_64 ReleaseFast executable was built
with a fresh compiler cache and verified SHA-256:
`dfdbe000a2712b11d0919a4dc66888c51f905030d3d14a8a360bee4d5cbc3265`.
The driver used eight allowed CPUs (`0-6,8`) on a pod requesting four CPUs and
limited to eight; these were not dedicated cores. The retry scenario retained
all 36 provider attempts and the real production backoff.

Complete logs, runner script, and machine-checked acceptance manifest are in
`/private/tmp/ci694-replication-acceptance-results.tar.gz`, SHA-256
`f78936d40adbf5f6b96519bdc3a8c871e96531b0f168a838192531326515a9cd`,
verified against the runner archive. Historical failure archives remain
preserved separately. This acceptance result does not establish that unrelated
flakes cannot occur; deterministic regressions and evidence limits are recorded
below. GitHub CI is tracked separately from this controlled Linux soak.

## 2026-09-11: delayed Raft responses amplify metadata replication (#694)

The full `42cb81c6a` run completed **297/300**: quickstart 99/100,
backup/restore 98/100, retry exhaustion 100/100. Complete preserved evidence is
in `/private/tmp/ci694-durable-complete-results.tar.gz`. Its second restore
timeout also showed amplified Raft batches and one lagging metadata replica.

The new mixed Linux run on `42cb81c6a` failed backup/restore immediately in
worker 1. Metadata node 1 quarantined its group after one Ready batch exceeded
the existing hard outbound ceiling at 1,144,753,225 bytes. Preserved logs/state
and native stacks: `/private/tmp/ci694-durable-first-failure.tar.gz`, SHA-256
`70658edd776376a2c5dc2a966b59d6941b0ea9a37b3030200e8d7fe835350657`.

A deterministic regression shows an early acknowledgement resending 31 entries
already in flight. The leader now preserves monotonic replication progress,
ignores stale rejections and prior-term acknowledgements, and uses empty
heartbeat probes to recover a lost append/ack without enlarging its window.
Quorum commit also requires a current-term entry. All 401 Raft library tests
pass; the corrected snapshot-abort history matches the etcd oracle. See
`../FLAKES.md` for before/after evidence and protocol details. This is another
failed acceptance run; the fresh corrected run recorded above passes 100/100
for all three scenarios.

The standalone quickstart failure also exposed an invalid test assumption:
one searchable artifact does not guarantee that Alpha has published ahead of
Beta. A controlled provider gate proves the partial milestone can succeed with
only Beta searchable; complete publication then returns Alpha first. The test
retains its partial milestone check and uses `complete` before exact ranking,
with unchanged wait bounds and no query retries. Complete-query failures now
include readiness and query diagnostics. This probe does not reproduce the
original empty-hit result itself; see `../FLAKES.md` for the evidence limits.

## 2026-09-11: unit CI retention assertion races legitimate consumer progress (#694)

Run `34543627560`, x86 job `103092055515`, failed the provider-restart storage
test because its negative index-progress assertion raced a healthy derived
consumer. The revised test explicitly waits for that consumer, then verifies
that enrichment's independent durable checkpoint retains the failed source
record and that restart generates both searchable embeddings. Three focused
retention checks pass; see `../FLAKES.md` for the original log and contract.

## 2026-09-10: 299/300 identifies replacement persistence and abort outcome defects (#694)

The `9e5b558ce` mixed run finished at 23:57 UTC with quickstart **100/100**,
backup/restore **99/100**, and retry exhaustion **100/100**. Complete logs and the
one preserved failure root are in
`/private/tmp/ci694-authority-complete-results.tar.gz`; the downloaded archive's
SHA-256 matches the runner copy. This remains failed acceptance.

The failed shard's durable Raft history contains an overwritten term-2 prepare
at index 4 on node 4, while nodes 5 and 6 retain the new leader's term-3 no-op.
Review reproduced the missing persistence-watermark invalidation. All three
transaction records are aborted; a second regression reproduced an unknown
prepare outcome escaping despite a confirmed coordinator abort. The fixes bind
persistence to entry identity and preserve the proven abort decision, with
existing bounded stateless retries and unchanged deadlines. See `../FLAKES.md`
for the before/after regressions and exact history. Fresh 100-per-scenario
acceptance must include these fixes as well as the forwarding and placement
review changes below.

## 2026-09-10: review closes forwarding and placement authority gaps (#694)

The `9e5b558ce` mixed soak had a backup seed-write `409 write outcome unknown`
and therefore failed acceptance. The first failure is preserved in
`/private/tmp/ci694-first-final-failure.tar.gz`; the durable transaction records
show abort on all three groups. The subsequent investigation is recorded above.

Independent deterministic review probes reproduced Raft transport starvation
from sharing its executor with forwarded writes, and changed placement bypassing
authority when two peers return the same lifecycle counter. Forwarding now has
separate bounded whole-request admission. Placement reuse compares the exact
plan inputs, including remote member rows and split bootstrap inputs. See
`../FLAKES.md` for the production contract, resource budget, and before/after
regressions. Fresh 100/100 runs for each of the three split scenarios must use
these completed changes; earlier passing subsets do not count.

## 2026-09-10: data-Raft placement requires authority before retirement (#694)

The preserved `sjng4qip` backup failure contained repeated restored-group
admissions followed by `ConflictingDataApplyBatch`. A deterministic data-runtime
regression reproduced destructive retirement from an older empty catalog whose
process-local metadata epoch was larger: group 77 changed from active to absent.
The fix requires a coherent linearizable snapshot for changed local placement,
serializes its acquisition with reconciliation, and leaves unchanged placement
on the cached path. Equal epoch counters from different metadata processes do
not suppress a genuinely authoritative deletion. See `../FLAKES.md` for the
production contract and before/after artifacts.

The prior 294/300 mixed run and 57/60 old-runtime backup diagnostic remain failed
historical runs. Fresh 100-per-scenario acceptance must use the completed
placement-authority fix together with the resident-owner, CDC, backup-ABI, and
Raft-cadence fixes; no old passing subset counts toward that acceptance.

## 2026-09-10: bounded coverage follow-up acceptance (#694)

The `00dd1e4aef` Linux ReleaseFast executable
(`7ef883c0c2928ece1562e62f6518b57316cd0a66628988ec59ae883ce3e3a033`)
ran 100 of each split scenario with four workers and no failed-case retries.
The run ended at 20:42 UTC with **294/300**, not passing acceptance:
quickstart 99/100, 3x3 backup/restore 95/100, retry exhaustion 100/100.
Failures: post-restart RAG resident availability, fatal restore apply conflict,
fatal metadata `NotLeader`, backup timeout, repository teardown collision, and
DELETE conflict. Preserved archive:
`/private/tmp/ci694-bounded-soak-failures.tar.gz`; extracted state:
`/private/tmp/ci694-bounded-soak-state/`.

The next diagnostic run retained that runtime and used the corrected repository
lifetime and native stack capture. It completed **57/60** backup cases. Failures
were metadata `NotLeader`, metadata outbound Ready growth past its hard ceiling
followed by `GroupLeaderUnavailable`, and a seed write with an unknown outcome.
All three native stack captures succeeded. Archive:
`/private/tmp/ci694-diagnostic-failures.tar.gz`; extracted state:
`/private/tmp/ci694-diagnostic-state/`. These diagnostic runs are not combined
with acceptance for subsequent production changes.

Cold repair ownership, CDC scheduling admission, and backup ambiguity transport
have deterministic regressions and fixes recorded in `../FLAKES.md`. Fresh
100/100 acceptance for the complete implementation remains outstanding.

Track intermittent failures with their original evidence, the contract being
tested, and repeated validation. A passing soak reduces uncertainty; it does not
establish the cause of a failure that was not reproduced locally. Keep resolved
entries so later failures can be compared with the original signature.

### Serverless publication retry contract (#503)

Both failures returned HTTP 503 with the publication-authority retry message;
the runtime logs reported `WorkLeaseLost` while background maintenance was
enabled. The PR changed this condition from generic 500 `build failed` to
503 with `Retry-After: 1`. The E2E build helper still retried only 409 or the
old 500 response, so the new transient response failed immediately.

The helper now retries 409 and 503 with valid `Retry-After` delta-seconds.
It respects the advertised delay, caps request timeouts by remaining time,
and shares a single deadline with the outer publication/readiness loop.
Missing or malformed retry headers and generic 500 responses fail immediately;
in particular, missing external-source resolution is not silently retried.
Document mutation POSTs are never replayed by this policy. Runtime lease
fencing and publication success/readiness assertions are unchanged.

`test_publication_retry.py` exercises the exact CI response deterministically,
including deadline exhaustion, scheduler sleep overshoot, bounded readiness
polling, permanent errors, and no replay of batch mutations. These tests verify
client behavior; they do not claim to identify which background lease holder
caused the original contention.

Validation after merging `origin/main` at `aefe3bad4`: the final ReleaseFast
binary passed both affected tests on both backends (4/4), then ten repetitions
of each serverless case (20/20). Reproduce the soak from the repository root:

```sh
SKIP_BUILD=1 ANTFLY_BIN=./zig-out/bin/antfly \
  ANTFLY_E2E_ENV_FILE=/dev/null ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPEATS=10 \
  scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh \
  'e2e/antfly/test_index_lifecycle.py::test_table_chunker_full_text_index_routes_template_chunks[serverless]' \
  'e2e/antfly/test_sparse.py::test_semantic_query_embedding_template_supports_remote_text[serverless]'
```

The retry/create-contract/standalone harness selection passed 97 tests,
the graph/storage selection passed 219 with no leaks, and the full serverless
suite passed 1,083 with six skips and no leaks. The initial sandboxed soak
could not bind local ports; the permitted rerun above completed successfully.

### Completed CLI readiness regresses after publication (#696)

The CI job reported 397 passed, five skipped, and two failures: this CLI
readiness regression and the backup seed 409 described below. The CLI test
had already observed complete readiness through `index get`, then found
`observation_complete=false` through `index list` without another source
mutation. Revision and coverage counts remained intact. The
[runtime entry](../FLAKES.md#completed-cli-index-readiness-regresses-after-a-delayed-notification-696-694)
records the callback ordering, epoch-qualified fix, and deterministic tests.

Linux validation uses the original CI artifact from head `5c54729b6` as the
baseline and PR #694 with main merged as the fixed source. The repository's
`scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh` runs both failing node IDs with three
workers and ten repetitions per worker, pinned to eight CPUs on a disposable
runner with a fresh filesystem. The baseline reproduces both CI signatures.

The baseline finished **47/60 passed**: CLI **29/30**, with one matching
readiness regression; backup **18/30**, with ten seed-write 409s, one completed
restore-progress retirement timeout, and one 30-second HTTP read timeout.
The latter two failures are separate observations, not evidence for the
forwarding executor cause. The original binary lacks the added underlying
transport-error diagnostics. Raw worker logs were retained for comparison.

The exact `3ab5f6aba` executable from passing Linux CI run `34439124254`
then finished **59/60 passed** under the same mixed load: CLI **29/30** and
backup/restore **30/30**. The remaining CLI failure matched the same completed
target-6 signature. This exposed the independent exact-index callback path;
the follow-up fix preserves its completed observation while retaining source
and delete watermarks. Metadata also now owns atomic restore-progress
retirement and rejects stale incarnation reports at apply time; see the
[runtime entry](../FLAKES.md#restore-completion-owns-progress-retirement-694).

Final acceptance requires **100/100 for each affected test**, using the branch
with the native-storage main merge and all fixes, without failure retries.

The follow-up Linux soak of `70e0b11869` is **not a passing acceptance run**.
It finished **292/300 passed**: quickstart **98/100**, backup/restore **96/100**,
and independent retry exhaustion **98/100** (the four backup non-passes include
one fixture setup error). The final retry failure occurred during its healthy
seed and exposed [coverage reads across an atomic commit](../FLAKES.md#coverage-reads-straddle-the-first-atomic-outcome-commit-694).
It exposed thumbnail activation without a runtime owner observation, two
metadata exits after slow successful WAL sync, and a seed batch with unknown
write outcome. Failure roots and raw worker logs were retained. See the
[runtime diagnosis](../FLAKES.md#slow-raft-sync-kills-the-runtime-targeted-activation-joins-sibling-work-694)
for the production changes and remaining write-timeout investigation. A fresh
100-per-scenario soak is required after those changes. The later partial-source
replay failure and stale follower job read now have separate
[production regressions](../FLAKES.md#partial-source-replay-and-stale-follower-restore-job-observations-694).

The CLI quickstart now separates retry exhaustion into
`test_cli_index_wait_survives_retry_exhaustion_and_restart`. The quickstart
retains the 10.5-second maintenance observation, completed list/detail
readiness, restart, image query, and RAG assertions. The dedicated test owns
its initial healthy corpus, exhausts the unchanged provider retry policy,
then checks isolated failure, later progress, and partial-generation restart.
Both tests restore their mock provider state during cleanup. A Linux run of
both tests passed: quickstart **13.37 s**, retry exhaustion **65.73 s**, including
**62.31 s / 36 provider requests** before exhaustion. The earlier integrated
quickstart averaged 77.2 s. Focused readiness soaks use the quickstart node ID;
the retry-policy test remains in the ordinary E2E suite.

Running the new test independently then exposed an additional initial-build
availability defect: three of four exploratory executions failed while one
passed. The durable repair checkpoint recorded terminal
`RepairSourceCoverageIncomplete` for catalog admission, despite a previously
published healthy image. The [runtime entry](../FLAKES.md#initial-catalog-admission-quarantines-a-healthy-generation-on-shadow-coverage-lag-694)
records the fix and deterministic before/after regression; fixed-runtime Linux
validation remains pending.

### Three-by-three backup seed batch: unknown outcome (#694)

The run reported 394 passed, five skipped, and one failure. Table creation and
three-shard, three-voter replication checks succeeded, but the initial batch
seeding three fixed document keys returned HTTP 409 `write outcome unknown`.
The test failed before starting backup. Both routing-watch unit tests and the
inference E2E suite passed in the same run. The failed aggregate checks merely
report their child-job failures; they are not additional flakes.

This is distinct from the earlier 503 `write unavailable` admission rejection.
The seeding helper correctly refuses to replay an ambiguous generic batch.
Its immediate error path now includes the six server log tails, status, response
body, and chained exception, just like the deadline-exhaustion path. Fast tests
cover this exact 409, transport failures, and other non-admission errors, require
diagnostics, and verify that each fails after one POST.

The failure reproduced on current main with #692 included: 1/30 initial runs,
then 7/60 instrumented runs, using three concurrent soak workers. Every
instrumented failure reported `ConcurrencyUnavailable` in the group batch
forwarder. The [runtime investigation](../FLAKES.md#backup-seed-forwarding-exhausts-the-control-executor-694)
records the executor fix and deterministic before/after regression.

The fixture was also missing from the scheduler's legacy process-fixture list,
which still named its predecessor `multi_metadata_backup_cluster`. It now
declares `@e2e_resource("antfly_process")` directly, so future fixture renames
retain the declaration. Actual pytest collection changes from `light--test--`
to `antfly-process--test--`; the six-process cluster now consumes a process
resource slot. The concurrent soak uses independent pytest workers and still
stresses multiple clusters simultaneously.

Validation on 2026-09-09 (America/Los_Angeles), macOS ARM64, native Debug:

- 128 harness and scheduler tests passed.
- The saturated-control forwarding regression failed before the executor fix
  and passed afterward; borrowed I/O and error-classification checks passed.
- All 114 focused forwarding, HTTP-client, and Raft checks passed after updating
  three stale expectations for the distinct internal transport-ambiguity error.
- Fixed-runtime soak: **59/60 passed**, three workers × twenty repetitions.
  No seed-write 409 occurred; one run failed before seeding at table-create
  admission, detailed below. This is not a clean full-test soak.
- Pinned Ruff lint/format checks, Zig formatting, and diff checks passed.
- Linux CI remains cross-platform validation.

The fixed Debug executable SHA-256 was
`ad61b7bdfd43fd6e425e44caab2e8c8a9d2252f7b366356fe7b12b6eb96454a8`.
The final soak log is `/private/tmp/pr694-backup-outbound-fixed-soak.log`.

Original CI diagnostics were insufficient to prove that CI hit the same internal
error; the local reproduction and deterministic regression establish a concrete
cause of the matching failure signature. Baseline soak logs are retained in
`/private/tmp/pr694-backup-fixed-soak.log` (the earlier scheduler/diagnostics-only
change) and `/private/tmp/pr694-backup-transport-soak.log` (underlying error added).

#### Table-create admission timeout during #694 validation

Worker 1, iteration 11 of the first forwarding-fix soak exhausted the existing
30-second create-admission budget after five HTTP 503 responses with
`metadata_leader_unavailable`, `X-Antfly-Metadata-Mutation-Not-Admitted: true`,
and `X-Antfly-Metadata-Not-Leader: true`. It had not reached seed writes or the
changed batch forwarder. The original six logs did not identify the internal
cause, so they cannot prove which discovery defect occurred in that run.

The [runtime investigation](../FLAKES.md#metadata-mutation-discovery-exhausts-admission-time-694)
reproduced both a first-endpoint status probe consuming the entire mutation
budget and a returned Raft role referencing a freed response buffer. Bounded
endpoint probes, stable endpoint coverage, and role stabilization before
response release fix those defects. Public retry policy, production deadlines,
and the prohibition on replaying ambiguous writes remain unchanged.

The live stalled-status reproduction failed before the fix with the same five
pre-admission 503 responses, then passed the full backup/restore case afterward.
The retained proxy test keeps every direct metadata node address available
beside its stalled alternate route and activates the fault after bootstrap.
This preserves a discoverable leader across elections. An earlier proxy version
replaced one node address; elections could make that hidden node the only
leader, violating the test's healthy-leader assumption.

Exploratory validation is retained separately from the final soak:

- A diagnostic baseline had one `AddressInUse` startup collision in 60 runs,
  before the first public request; this was not the table-create failure.
- Overlapping three-worker ordinary and three-worker proxy soaks with other
  local builds raised host load above 100. The ordinary run passed 56/60:
  three restore-progress retirement timeouts and one seed 409 after Raft apply
  timeouts and thousands of transport send failures. The proxy run was stopped
  to correct its endpoint assumption and reduce concurrent load. These results
  do not establish that the discovery changes fix the separate stress failures.
- Logs: `/private/tmp/pr694-create-full-diagnostic-soak.log`,
  `/private/tmp/pr694-create-proxy-before.log`,
  `/private/tmp/pr694-create-proxy-after.log`,
  `/private/tmp/pr694-create-fixed-soak.log`, and
  `/private/tmp/pr694-stalled-overlap-workers/`.

Final validation on macOS ARM64, native Debug, with remote PR commits through
`d0aa27d49` merged and the discovery/ownership and resolver-drain fixes applied:

- **90/90 full backup/restore runs passed**: 60 ordinary and 30 with a stalled
  alternate metadata status route. Three workers total; each ran ten rounds of
  two ordinary tests followed by one faulted test. No table-create, seed-write,
  backup, restore, or retirement failure occurred.
- 100 metadata service, four data discovery/status, five resolver-backfill,
  and 173 derived-coverage checks passed without leaks. All 134 Python
  harness/scheduler checks passed, as did pinned Ruff, Zig format, and diff checks.
- Log: `/private/tmp/pr694-final-merged-backup-soak.log`.
- Executable SHA-256:
  `bae3921f715c8e2f0e3a0d0aeb40088391d4600d611b473a79c3c618d87f28df`.

After merging `origin/main` at `8211fc92c4`, the rebuilt native Debug executable
passed a further **20/20** serial runs: ten ordinary backup/restore runs and ten
with the stalled alternate metadata status route. The affected Zig suites
passed 513 tests without leaks, and all 67 Python harness tests passed. The
merge retained both sets of transport diagnostics and corrected an upstream
empty-create assertion to include the newly persisted default storage setting.
Log: `/private/tmp/pr694-main-merge-backup-soak.log`. Executable SHA-256:
`bbf4146d631ee247fccde9deb3f6de995c68a429ec66179dd8aa15aecaf2f7dd`.

The matching local reproductions establish concrete discovery defects; the
original failed run's logs do not prove which one it encountered. The clean
final soak is evidence of the merged behavior, not proof that unrelated
higher-load or port-handoff failures are eliminated.

### Quickstart restart fixture and HA replication startup (#657)

The job reported 376 passed, five skipped, and two failures. The quickstart
Boolean-query assertions passed, then accessing `backup_api.supports_restart`
raised `AttributeError`: that fixture does not expose a restart lifecycle.
The test now uses the existing `stateful_api` restart contract and requests a
fresh process. All query assertions still run before and after the local
restart, without restarting a module-shared runtime.

The HA case failed at the first document write after the bootstrapped standby
restarted with continuous replication enabled. The primary returned HTTP 503,
`write committed locally; standby durability acknowledgment pending`. That is
a post-commit outcome and must not be retried as an unadmitted write.

The fixture waited for `/readyz`, but that endpoint does not promise a completed
upstream replication round. Bootstrap and restart also restore `received_lsn`
and `applied_lsn` before the background replication loop connects. The test now
waits for a successful live round (`last_success_ns`), no current replication
error, and the expected applied LSN before issuing synchronous writes after
either restart. A successful round includes the upstream status acknowledgement.
The wait uses the existing 20-second observation budget, caps each read request
by its remaining time, fails on process exit, and reports the last snapshot
plus both nodes' logs. Write success, applied data, remote durability, restart
recovery, and rejection of standby writes remain required. Production policy
and the two-second synchronous acknowledgement budget are unchanged.

The new `test_standby_replication_startup.py` regression forwards authenticated
HA requests through a local proxy that delays only the first replication fetch
by three seconds. Disabling only the live-round requirement reproduces the
exact pending-durability 503; enabling it passes the complete original HA case.
Fast harness tests distinguish restored progress from a live round, retain
applied-LSN requirements, reject unsuccessful replication, bound requests, and
fail immediately on process exit.

This establishes the missing startup precondition. The original Linux CI log
contained only primary logs, so it cannot establish what delayed that standby's
first acknowledgement. All 69 unmodified local HA repetitions passed. A passing
soak or injected startup delay does not prove the original CI stall's internal
cause. HA fixture failures now emit both nodes' logs for future comparison.

Validation on 2026-09-08 (America/Los_Angeles), macOS ARM64, based on merged
`origin/main` commit `50e923cb5`, using one unchanged native Debug executable:

- Native build: 27/27 steps passed. Executable SHA-256:
  `051121877ef7fe6c5230c00138cc9f0b1b990ffac68a6a4c8a93387bfa0e26e9`.
- Baseline mixed soak: three workers × three repetitions; quickstart failed
  9/9 with `AttributeError`, while HA passed 9/9. Additional HA baseline:
  six workers × ten repetitions, 60/60 passed.
- Corrected proxy comparison: one failure with the live-round check disabled,
  one pass with it enabled, using the same executable and three-second delay.
- 133 fast harness and scheduler checks passed.
- Final mixed soak: **90/90 passed**, three workers × ten repetitions of each
  of the two original cases and the delayed-fetch regression (30 per case).
- `make fmt`, Ruff checks on the three HA test files, and `git diff --check`
  passed. The quickstart file has an unrelated pre-existing broad-exception
  lint finding outside this change.

The final mixed soak uses the repository regression loop from the worktree root:

```sh
SKIP_BUILD=1 ANTFLY_E2E_ENV_LOADED=1 \
ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_WORKERS=3 ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_REPEATS=10 \
ANTFLY_E2E_PRESERVE_FAILURE_LIMIT=2 \
scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh \
  e2e/antfly/test_quickstart.py::test_public_quickstart_query_string_boolean_controls \
  e2e/antfly/test_standby.py::test_standby_streams_public_writes_restarts_and_rejects_writes \
  e2e/antfly/test_standby_replication_startup.py::test_standby_waits_for_delayed_first_replication
```

Local evidence is retained in `/private/tmp/antfly-pr657-*.log`, including
`baseline-soak`, `ha-baseline-soak`, `delayed-before-corrected`,
`delayed-fixed-proxy`, and `fixed-soak`. The initial proxy prototype omitted
the GET identity handshake and its failed runs are excluded from the comparison.
Linux CI remains the cross-platform validation.

### Retrieval streaming teardown

The retrieval assertions passed, then the reusable fixture's DELETE failed with
`ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer')`. The old cleanup made one
attempt and discarded the server diagnostics. The CI artifact contained only the
executable, so it cannot establish whether that reset was a transport failure or
a server failure.

Cleanup now retries an idempotent DELETE at most three times within its existing
30-second request budget. A retry may return 404 when the original DELETE
succeeded but its response was lost. Process-exit checks run before and after
requests; exited servers and HTTP errors still fail. Exhausted transport errors
include bounded server logs and process status. Recovered transport failures are
printed in the soak log rather than silently discarded.

Deterministic harness tests cover resets, successful deletion before response
loss, deadline/attempt exhaustion, HTTP errors, and server crashes. The original
CI reset has not been reproduced naturally in the local soak.

The review of #660 also found that lock contention could escape this cleanup
deadline. Follow-up [`5e05d2314`](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/commit/5e05d2314a6555a73f5dfa20766f5587b42d6f6e)
bounds lock acquisition by the remaining time and rechecks the deadline before
DELETE. Regression cases cover lock timeout, late acquisition, and retry-sleep
overshoot, including lock release on failure. A further 30/30 retrieval teardown
soak runs passed with the existing main-based executable.

### Three-by-three backup seeding

The first document batch returned HTTP 503 with `write unavailable`, after the
test observed three healthy voters and a known leader for each shard. That
metadata observation does not hold a lease on the current data leader or routing
catalog. The public write API explicitly distinguishes this pre-commit
unavailability from ambiguous and post-commit outcomes.

The fixture now seeds documents through a bounded admission loop that retries
only the exact `503 write unavailable` response. Transport failures, other HTTP
errors, ambiguous transactions, and pending durability acknowledgements remain
failures. The original assertions still verify every seeded document, all three
shard payloads in the backup, and restored documents through every data node.

Harness regressions cover eventual admission, retry classification, deadline
diagnostics, and process exit. The specific CI rejection has not been
reproduced naturally in the local soak.

### Three-by-three backup table creation: unknown outcome

The #664 recurrence failed earlier than the seeding case above: the initial
`POST /db/v1/tables/metadata_leader_backup_<unique suffix>` returned HTTP 409,
`table mutation outcome is unknown; observe table state before retrying`.
The job reported 352 passed, five skipped, and this one failure. Its failure
log did not contain the cluster diagnostics needed to locate the failure.
The test now attaches all six server log tails when that initial create fails.

Investigation found that `MetadataHttpService.ensureLinearizableReadWithContext`
ran a **ticking** Raft round on each iteration of its 1 ms polling loop. The
runtime also has a dedicated cadence driver. Read traffic could therefore
advance elections, heartbeats, and virtual time independently of elapsed time.
A captured stack showed a routing read executing this path; the accompanying
runtime diagnostics reported virtual time well ahead of elapsed time.

The fix uses the existing progress-only Raft operations in
that read loop, including pending-update synchronization. The dedicated ticker
continues to own election and heartbeat time. ReadIndex requests, quorum
requirements, request deadlines, and the E2E create-success assertion remain
unchanged. Unknown outcomes remain non-retryable; this fix does not turn a 409
into success or replay a possibly committed mutation.

The local investigation also exposed socket pressure under three concurrent
six-node clusters: `AddressUnavailable` in data control rounds and Python
`EADDRNOTAVAIL`, with 45,747 TCP sockets in `TIME_WAIT`. Changing the fixture's
5 ms ticks to the runtime's 100 ms defaults did not solve the issue: that probe
reproduced the create 409 near the forwarding deadline. No cadence override
change is included in the fix.

A deterministic regression starts without a leader and gives a read waiter a
50 ms deadline. Before the fix, that waiter advanced virtual time from zero to
3,800 ms. With the fix, it times out without advancing time or electing itself.
The test then advances the dedicated cadence driver, verifies leader election,
and completes a ReadIndex request without any further virtual-time advance.
This proves the clock ownership bug; the original CI log alone cannot establish
which internal timeout produced its 409.

The first Debug soak then exposed a distinct initial-create failure:
`503 metadata_leader_unavailable`. The server's
`metadataMutationNotAdmittedResponse` marks this response with
`X-Antfly-Metadata-Mutation-Not-Admitted: true`, a stronger guarantee than a
leader-routing hint. Even a quorum-backed leader observation cannot reserve
mutation authority for a subsequent request. The fixture now honors this
pre-admission contract within the original 30-second create budget, using a
one-second backoff and the remaining budget for each request.

Retry requires HTTP 503, that explicit non-admission marker, the exact
`metadata_leader_unavailable` code, and `retryable: true`. A contradictory
unknown/committed outcome marker forbids retry. Transport errors, unmarked
503s, ambiguous 409s, and process exits still fail. The create must return a
successful response, and every replication, backup payload, and restore
assertion remains. Recovered admission attempts are printed in the soak log;
failures retain the last status, headers, body, and all server log tails.

### CLI image readiness

`index wait --until searchable-artifacts=1` succeeded, but the following source
coverage assertion saw `covered == 0`. Query-visible vectors and the asynchronous
source census have independent publication points. The searchable-artifact wait
contract checks queryability and visible vectors, not source coverage.

The test now checks the matching milestone at each stage: at least one queryable
vector after the searchable-artifact wait, then exact source outcomes after
complete readiness. The later assertions still require one covered source, two
skipped sources, zero failures, and a successful image query. No wait deadline
was increased and no source-coverage assertion was removed from final completion.

The specific premature assertion did not fail naturally in the local soak.

### CLI provider retry exhaustion with real backoff

This is a different phase of the CLI pipeline; #660 did not fix it. The test
keeps returning HTTP 503 for the ClipClap provider and expects the request to
exhaust its budget, become a per-source failure, and leave the shared enrichment
worker and sibling text index healthy. CI still reported one pending source,
zero failed sources, eight retryable errors, and a live retrying worker when the
30-second assertion expired.

PR #659 restores real sleeps in `enrichment_runtime.zig`. Previously, the
`@hasDecl(std.Thread, "sleep")` guard skipped inline sleeps with Zig 0.16. The
default policy allows six worker attempts, each with six provider attempts:

- Inline delays per worker attempt: 0.25 + 0.5 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.75 seconds.
- Five worker backoffs: 0.5 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.5 seconds.
- Total scheduled delay before exhaustion: 6 × 7.75 + 15.5 = **62 seconds**,
  before HTTP, storage, or scheduler overhead.

The assertion now has a named, finite 90-second allowance for that policy. It
still requires a terminal source failure, repeated provider calls, a healthy
shared worker and text index, and later successful image work. The test reports
elapsed retry time and provider-request count. The CLI fixture stops the server
during teardown and defers the directory cleanup decision until the completed
teardown report, so the regression script can retain failed runtime roots and
logs, including failures in the module's last fixture teardown.

The unchanged 30-second test failed in all three workers against the existing
PR #659 executable, reproducing the CI signature. This demonstrates a test budget
that was incompatible with the real retry schedule, not a need to remove
production backoff or weaken per-source failure isolation.

With the fix, all nine runs passed against that same executable. Each exhausted
36 provider requests in 62.63–63.21 seconds, matching the scheduled backoff.

A temporary 300 ms activation hook reproduced the exact `indexes_rebuilt`
assertion on main. The functional test now uses the existing 5-second completion
budget; the 250 ms production policy is unchanged. The injected case passed
before removing the temporary hook. Twenty subsequent repetitions of the repair
test and the production deadline test passed (40 test executions), using
`zig/tools/run_bounded_zig_build.py` while the E2E soak ran.

- Initial mixed-load check using the existing PR #658 executable: three workers,
  three repetitions of each case, **27/27 passed**. This included the teardown
  recovery change; the backup and CLI tests were still unchanged.
- Fixed main-based checkout: three workers, ten repetitions of each case,
  **90/90 passed** (30 per case), with no recovered cleanup transport errors.
- Fast harness, scheduler, and metadata leader-discovery regressions:

### Follow-up validation after #660

2026-09-07 (America/Los_Angeles), macOS ARM64, based on #660's squash merge
[`3ce736ee6`](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/commit/3ce736ee67a547e196423480ed6a079576a93582):

- Cleanup deadline fix [`5e05d2314`](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/commit/5e05d2314a6555a73f5dfa20766f5587b42d6f6e):
  **105 fast regressions passed**; the retrieval case passed **30/30**
  (three workers × ten repetitions) using the existing main-based executable
  from `.worktrees/fix-ci-repair-retrieval/zig/zig-out/bin/antfly`.
- CLI retry budget fix [`19b988108`](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/commit/19b9881080af1dbc805f9ad5bda096b62bf063b1):
  **3/3 failed before**, **9/9 passed after** (three workers × three repetitions
  after the fix). Both used the existing PR #659 executable from
  `.worktrees/std-io-migration-audit/zig/zig-out/bin/antfly`, exercising real
  retry sleeps. The 105 fast regressions also passed with this change.
- Review correction [`d058ddb2f`](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/commit/d058ddb2ff4e478f1b539774cf3938a3d711cf9d):
  **113 fast regressions passed**, including eight real-pytest lifecycle cases
  covering setup, call, final teardown, earlier-test failures, preservation
  settings, successful cleanup, and directory cleanup errors. These tests use
  the real CLI fixture and server shutdown method without launching a server.

Both soaks used `scripts/ci/zig-e2e-regression-loop.sh` with `SKIP_BUILD=1`,
`ANTFLY_BIN` set to the executable above, and the corresponding test node ID.
These are local macOS results; Linux CI remains the cross-platform check.

### Follow-up validation for #664

2026-09-08 (America/Los_Angeles), macOS ARM64, based on `origin/main`
[`fea3e6611`](https://github.com/antflydb/antfly/commit/fea3e66111a3f39f8cc95a8c71e31d6e30f2dc5f),
in `.worktrees/fix-metadata-backup-create-flake`:

- The native **Debug** build passed. Executable SHA-256:
  `65576850a6cbb3d934c8d158138a39dfa7d16f3cab79d80d7c5e0dcadf03611f`.
- **75 metadata service tests passed** in Debug, with zero leaks, including
  the read waiter clock regression. **114 Python harness, scheduler, and
  leader-discovery checks passed**.
- Original 5 ms fixture cadence, three workers × ten repetitions:
  **29/30 passed**. No unknown-outcome 409 recurred. Worker 2, iteration 2
  failed at initial create with the explicit pre-admission JSON response
  `503 metadata_leader_unavailable` for
  `metadata_leader_backup_1788900153771408000` through data node 4.
  This exposed the admission handling gap addressed next; this initial result
  is not a clean soak.
- A temporary probe removed only the fixture's `--raft-tick-ms` and
  `--control-tick-ms` overrides, retaining the original test assertions.
  At the runtime's 100 ms defaults, **9/9 passed** (three workers × three
  repetitions). Before the fix, this probe failed 9/9 with five initial-create
  unknown-outcome 409s. That earlier executable was ReleaseSafe, so the E2E
  comparison also changes optimization mode; the deterministic clock
  regression supplies the isolated evidence for the production bug.
- With the admission helper, **132 fast checks passed**, including 18 new
  cases covering safe admission retry, successful 200/202 responses, deadline
  exhaustion, backoff overshoot, process exit, and refusal to replay unmarked,
  malformed, conflicting, transport-failed, or ambiguous outcomes.
- Final original-cadence Debug soak with the admission helper:
  **100/100 passed**, four workers × 25 repetitions. No initial-create retries
  occurred in this batch; the deterministic harness cases exercise the
  recovered 503 path. The executable is unchanged from the initial Debug soak.

Local logs, the temporary comparison sources, and the failed six-node runtime

`soak-debug-100.log` records all 100 final passing executions.
The probe sources are not part of test collection. Linux CI validation remains

## 2026-09-19: VOPR runner loss and cluster-restore soak

Run `35446473661`, qualification job `105906153405`, lost its runner during
checkout. Retained GKE audit logs identify `PreemptionByScheduler` at
`2026-09-19T13:41:16Z`: the system `konnectivity-agent` pod needed 60 MiB and
reported insufficient memory on the available nodes. The runner exited with
SIGTERM (143), before compiling or testing. Recovery is limited to one retry of
this scheduled qualification job after a confirmed checkout shutdown; executed
tests and campaigns are never retried by that policy.

The separate production job completed the normal cluster-restore profile in
about 67 minutes, then hit the shared 90-minute budget during the constrained
profile. Give each profile its own job, reusing one production binary and
retaining two workers, 25 repetitions, and both test cases per profile. A local
single-profile run can set `ANTFLY_E2E_REGRESSION_PROFILE=normal` or `constrained`.
The default shell entrypoint still runs both profiles.

Every regression invocation now owns its process group, with a default
600-second timeout (`ANTFLY_E2E_CASE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). Timeout/cancellation and
normal parent exit stop remaining server descendants before returning. Reports
and executable evidence upload separately from retained database roots so a
root collection error cannot discard the reports.

The failed restore published its table but never completed; metadata contained
completion records for nodes 5 and 6, while proxied node 4 repeatedly logged
`CatalogRoutingSnapshotTimeout`. Startup catch-up applied the schema-index
25 ms admission/yield quantum even to ordinary startup and restore. A controlled
50 ms point-catalog delay reproduced the same stuck job on main (142.54 s,
failed). Scoping those controls to schema-index work completed the identical
three-metadata/three-data-node test in 30.24 s. Restore retains cancellation and
ownership fences; index repair retains its scheduling quantum. The E2E proxy
keeps the latency injection as a regression alongside the stalled status route.
