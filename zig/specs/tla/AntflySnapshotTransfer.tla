----------------------- MODULE AntflySnapshotTransfer -----------------------
(*
  TLA+ Formal Specification of Antfly's Multi-Raft Snapshot Transfer Protocol.

  Models the snapshot lifecycle and transfer mechanism used when a node
  needs to catch up after falling behind or joining the cluster.

  Implementation references:
    - src/raft/raft.go                  (maybeTriggerSnapshot, publishSnapshot,
                                         maybeFetchStorageSnapshot)
    - lib/multirafthttp/transport.go    (GetSnapshot — retry loop with
                                         exponential backoff, peer fallback)
    - lib/multirafthttp/pipeline.go     (getSnap — HTTP GET, error classification)
    - lib/multirafthttp/http.go         (snapHandler — serves snapshot files)
    - src/snapstore/snapstore.go        (SnapStore interface — Get/Put/Delete/Exists)

  Protocol summary:
    Snapshot Creation (leader only):
      1. After SnapshotCatchUpEntriesN (10,000) applied entries, leader calls
         maybeTriggerSnapshot.
      2. createStorageSnapshot produces a tar.zst archive.
      3. Raft snapshot metadata (pointing to archive ID) is persisted.
      4. Raft log is compacted up to appliedIndex - SnapshotCatchUpEntriesN.
      5. Old snapshot archive is deleted (GC).

    Snapshot Transfer (follower/joining node):
      1. Raft sends snapshot message to follower (MsgSnap).
      2. publishSnapshot extracts storage snapshot ID from Raft snapshot data.
      3. snapStore.Exists() checks if archive is already local.
      4. If not local, GetSnapshot retries across peers with exponential backoff.
      5. For each retry: iterate peers, call sendSnapshotRequest (HTTP GET).
      6. If peer has it: streams the archive, snapStore.Put() writes atomically.
      7. If peer returns 404: snapshot was GC'd on that peer.
      8. If ALL peers return 404: permanent failure (no retry).
      9. If some peers have transient errors: retry with backoff.
      10. On success: publishSnapshot signals commitC for application layer.

    Snapshot GC:
      After a new Raft snapshot is created, the old snapshot ID is deleted
      from the local SnapStore. Each node GCs independently — a snapshot
      may exist on some nodes and not others.

  Safety properties:
    - Applied snapshot is valid: a node only applies a snapshot it fully received.
    - No stale application: a snapshot is applied at the correct Raft index.
    - GC safety: a snapshot is not GC'd while it is the current snapshot.

  Liveness properties:
    - Transfer eventually succeeds: if any peer has the snapshot, the joining
      node eventually receives it.
    - Permanent failure detection: if no peer has the snapshot, the joining
      node eventually detects this and stops retrying.

  State space bounding:
    All variables have finite domains. RetryCount is bounded by MaxRetries.

  Boundary:
    Inside the model:
      - Snapshot creation and GC on leader nodes
      - Snapshot transfer pull from peers
      - Retry loop with peer fallback
      - Error categorization (permanent vs transient)
      - Node failure and recovery
      - Leadership changes

    Outside (assumptions):
      - Raft linearizability (snapshot index ordering)
      - Network eventual delivery within retries
      - SnapStore I/O correctness (atomic Put via temp+rename)
      - Archive format correctness (tar.zst)

  Leader triggers snapshot creation after enough entries are applied.
  Steps (raft.go:773-900):
    1. Generate new snapshot ID (snapCounter + 1)
    2. Create storage archive (createStorageSnapshot)
    3. Persist Raft snapshot metadata
    4. Compact Raft log
    5. GC old snapshot (delete oldSnapshotID from local store)

  The new snapshot replaces the old one on the leader.
  GC is modeled atomically with creation (in reality, GC is the last
  step of maybeTriggerSnapshot, line 890-899).

  Raft decides a follower needs a snapshot (follower is too far behind,
  or a new node is joining). The leader's current snapshot ID is sent.
  Maps to: Raft MsgSnap in the ready loop, triggering publishSnapshot.

Fairness ==
    \* --- Strong fairness (SF) for actions intermittently disabled by crashes ---
    \* Peer crashes and restarts make transfer-related actions toggle between
    \* enabled and disabled. WF only guarantees firing for *continuously*
    \* enabled actions. SF ensures an action fires if it is *repeatedly*
    \* enabled, even if disabled in between.
    \*
    \* TransferSucceeds: enabled when a peer with the snapshot is up, disabled
    \* when that peer crashes. SF reflects the real system's retry loop
    \* eventually hitting a window where the peer is available.
    /\ \A n \in Nodes : SF_vars(TransferSucceeds(n))
    \* TransferPermanentFailure: enabled when peers are up and all lack the
    \* snapshot (404), disabled when peers crash. SF ensures that if all
    \* available peers repeatedly confirm the snapshot is gone, the node
    \* eventually detects this as permanent.
    /\ \A n \in Nodes : SF_vars(TransferPermanentFailure(n))
    \* TransferRetry: enabled when no peers are available (transient — can't
    \* tell if it's permanent), disabled when peers come up. SF ensures the
    \* retry counter advances even with intermittent peer availability.
    /\ \A n \in Nodes : SF_vars(TransferRetry(n))
    \* --- Weak fairness (WF) for continuously-enabled actions ---
    \* These actions, once enabled, stay enabled until they fire.

    \* --- Strong fairness for leader election and node restart ---
    /\ \A n \in Nodes : SF_vars(ElectLeader(n))
    /\ \A n \in Nodes : WF_vars(NodeRestart(n))
    \* No fairness for CreateSnapshot (leader may or may not snapshot)
    \* No fairness for RaftSendsSnapshot (Raft decides when)
    \* No fairness for NodeCrash (failure action, nondeterministic)
