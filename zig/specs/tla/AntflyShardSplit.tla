--------------------------- MODULE AntflyShardSplit ---------------------------
(*
  TLA+ Formal Specification of Antfly's Online Shard Split Protocol.

  Models the zero-downtime shard split that coordinates across:
    - Metadata raft group (routing decisions, reconciler)
    - Parent storage raft group (split state machine, byte range, delta writes)
    - Child storage raft group (bootstrap, snapshot transfer, delta replay)
    - Table manager (heartbeat-driven metadata state transitions)

  Protocol summary:
    Phase 1 (Prepare):
      1. Reconciler decides to split oversized shard.
      2. PrepareSplit proposed through parent Raft: sets split state to
         PHASE_PREPARE. Parent now accepts writes to split-off range as deltas
         via isKeyOwnedDuringSplit (db.go:608-609).

    Phase 2 (Splitting -- two Raft proposals):
      3a. SetSplittingPhase proposed through parent Raft: transitions phase
          to SPLITTING.
      3b. SplitOp proposed through parent Raft: byteRange narrowed BEFORE
          archive creation (critical ordering for data safety). Parent
          continues accepting split-off writes via isKeyInSplitOffRangeForState
          even after byteRange narrows, storing them as split deltas.
      4. Metadata routing updated to reflect two shards.
      5. New shard started, loads archive snapshot.

    Phase 2b (Delta Replay):
      6. Child shard runs split replay loop (storedb.go:532-622), fetching
         delta entries from parent via ListSplitDeltaEntriesAfter.
      7. Child applies deltas with original HLC timestamps.
      8. Child is caught up (CanInitiateSplitCutover) when replay reaches
         the parent's current delta sequence. This is NOT sufficient for
         cutover -- only for triggering the finalize process.

    Phase 3 (Finalize -- non-atomic, two steps):
      9. Reconciler triggers FinalizeSplit when child is caught up
         (CanInitiateSplitCutover: HasSnapshot && !Initializing && Lead!=0
          && SplitReplayCaughtUp) and has been stable for 15s
         (trackAndCheckSplitFinalizeReady).
     10. Parent sets splitDeltaFinalSeq barrier (storedb.go:1402-1408).
         This is persisted to Pebble BEFORE waiting for the child.
         If the wait times out (15s), the fence remains set but the split
         is not completed. The reconciler can retry with a new fence.
     11. Parent waits for child to replay through fence (storedb.go:1411).
     12. Parent deletes split-off data and clears split state.
     13. Child becomes SplitCutoverReady (storedb.go:605 or 616).

    Phase 4 (Tablemgr Metadata Transition):
     14. Tablemgr (heartbeat-driven) transitions child SplitOffPreSnap ->
         Default ONLY when IsReadyForSplitReads (requires SplitCutoverReady
         AND Lead!=0).
     15. Tablemgr transitions parent PreSplit/Splitting -> Default when
         splitOffShardIsReady (requires child IsReadyForSplitReads).

    Write Routing (write_routing.go):
      - During split, metadata routes writes for child keys to the parent
        shard when the child is not ready (shouldRouteWriteToParent).
      - Parent accepts these writes via isKeyOwnedDuringSplit and stores
        them as SplitDeltaEntry records (db.go:698-721).
      - Once child is ready (IsReadyForSplitReads with SplitCutoverReady),
        metadata routes directly to child.

    Key invariant (the bug this model catches):
      SplitReplayCaughtUp ("child is currently tailing") is NOT the same as
      SplitCutoverReady ("child has completed cutover through final fence").
      Tablemgr must use the stronger SplitCutoverReady signal; using the
      weaker SplitReplayCaughtUp caused premature cutover and data loss.

    Rollback:
     16. If split times out, reconciler triggers rollback.
     17. Parent restores originalRangeEnd, clears split state and deltas.

  Safety properties:
    - No data loss: acknowledged writes are never lost during split.
    - No double-serving: metadata routing ensures writes go to exactly one
      shard (parent delta path XOR child direct path), enforced at the action
      level via mutually exclusive preconditions.
    - No premature cutover: child only reaches Default after cutover fence.
    - Rollback restores range: rolling back returns parent to original state.
    - ByteRange narrows before archive: critical ordering invariant.
    - Delta replay integrity: child can't replay what parent hasn't written.
    - Delta keys only during split: no stale deltas after finalize/rollback.
    - Read always available: every key can be read from some shard at all times.
    - Fence requires active split: splitDeltaFinalSeq only set during SPLITTING.

  Liveness properties (under fairness):
    - Split eventually completes or rolls back.

  Boundary:
    Inside the model:
      - Split state machine (NONE -> PREPARE -> SPLITTING -> NONE)
      - byteRange per phase (isKeyOwnedDuringSplit extends acceptance)
      - Two-phase TransitionToSplitting (SetSplittingPhase + ApplySplitOp)
      - Write routing: delta writes to parent vs direct writes to child
      - Split delta accumulation and replay
      - Metadata routing update ordering
      - New shard bootstrap lifecycle
      - Dual-actor race: tablemgr (heartbeat) vs reconciler (finalize)
      - SplitCutoverReady vs SplitReplayCaughtUp distinction
      - Non-atomic FinalizeSplit (fence set, then wait+delete)
      - Child leader election and loss
      - Read fallback to parent during split
      - Rollback mechanism
      - Leadership loss and gain on both parent and child
      - Timeout-triggered rollback
      - Concurrent client writes

    Outside (assumptions):
      - Raft linearizability within each shard
      - Network eventual delivery
      - Pebble storage correctness
      - Shadow IndexManager details
      - Archive I/O correctness
      - HLC timestamp ordering
      - Reconciler 15s grace period (trackAndCheckSplitFinalizeReady)

\* This is a LIVE check (derived predicate) that can oscillate as new deltas
\* arrive. It is the WEAKER readiness signal.
\* Maps to: splitReplayCaughtUp.Load() in storedb.go:602
\* Used by: CanInitiateSplitCutover (types.go) to trigger FinalizeSplit.
SplitReplayCaughtUp == parentDeltaKeys \subseteq childReplayedKeys

\* Whether the parent shard accepts a normal (non-delta) write for key k.
\* During an active split, writes to ChildKeys go through the delta path instead.
\* Maps to: byteRange.Contains(key) check in ValidateBatchKeys (storedb.go:740)
\*          for ParentKeys, or any key when no split is active.
ParentAcceptsNormalWrite(k) ==
    /\ k \in parentRange
    /\ ~(k \in ChildKeys /\ splitPhase \in {"prepare", "splitting"})

\* Whether the parent shard accepts a delta write for key k.
\* During PREPARE/SPLITTING, the parent accepts writes to the split-off range
\* via isKeyOwnedDuringSplit (db.go:608-609) which returns:
\*   byteRange.Contains(key) || isKeyInSplitOffRangeForState(key, state)
\* These writes are stored as SplitDeltaEntry records (db.go:698-721)
\* AND written to the parent's main Pebble store (Batch continues processing
\* the key normally after capturing the delta -- db.go:2300-2452).

    /\ newShardHasSnapshot
    /\ ~newShardInitializing
    /\ newShardHasLeader              \* RaftStatus.Lead != 0
    /\ SplitReplayCaughtUp

\* Whether the child shard accepts a write for key k (STRONGER check).
\* Child only accepts writes once fully ready: has snapshot, finished
\* initializing, has leader, routing updated, AND cutover is complete.
\* Maps to: IsReadyForSplitReads (types.go:130-133) which checks:
\*   HasSnapshot && !Initializing && Lead!=0
\*   && (!SplitReplayRequired || SplitCutoverReady)
\* CRITICAL: uses SplitCutoverReady (the strong signal), NOT SplitReplayCaughtUp.

    /\ ~newShardInitializing
    /\ newShardHasLeader              \* RaftStatus.Lead != 0
    /\ routingUpdated
    /\ splitCutoverReady

\* Whether a read for key k can be served from some shard.
\* Reads do NOT go through byteRange validation (only writes do).
\* Parent can serve reads for any key it has data for.
\* Child can serve reads once it has snapshot data -- reads are served from
\* local Pebble and do NOT require Raft leadership (follower/stale reads OK).
\* If routing sends reads to child but child not ready, reads fall back to
\* parent via shouldFallbackToParentShard (shard_routing.go).

  Child shard finishes loading indexes and clears the initializing flag.
  This makes it eligible for the reconciler to trigger FinalizeSplit
  (via CanInitiateSplitCutover), but does NOT transition to Default state.
  The tablemgr transition to Default requires the stronger SplitCutoverReady.

  SplitReplayCaughtUp (a live/oscillating signal). A write could arrive
  at the parent after the child was declared "caught up", creating a delta

  This models the FIRST part of applyOpFinalizeSplit (storedb.go:1402-1408):
  reading splitDeltaSeq and persisting splitDeltaFinalSeq to Pebble.
  The fence is set BEFORE waiting for the child to replay through it.

  After the fence is set, the Raft apply goroutine blocks waiting for the
  child (up to 15s). If the wait times out, the apply returns an error
  but the fence REMAINS SET in Pebble. Between retries, new delta writes
  can arrive (splitPhase is still "splitting"), which means the child
  must replay them too before FinalizeSplitComplete can succeed.

  NOTE: does NOT require newShardState = "default". The reconciler triggers
  FinalizeSplit based on CanInitiateSplitCutover (the weaker check), before
  the tablemgr transitions the child to Default.

  Between FinalizeSplitSetFence and FinalizeSplitComplete, new delta writes
  can arrive via ClientWriteDeltaToParent. The child must replay these
  additional deltas before completion can proceed.
