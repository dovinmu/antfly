  TLA+ Formal Specification of Antfly's Distributed Transaction Protocol.

  Models the full 2PC + OCC + recovery + cleanup protocol as implemented in:
    - src/metadata/transaction.go   (orchestrator: ExecuteTransaction)
    - src/store/db/db.go            (storage: InitTransaction, WriteIntent,
                                     ResolveIntents, transactionRecoveryLoop,
                                     notifyPendingResolutions, checkVersionPredicates,
                                     shouldWriteValue, hasConflictingIntentForKey)
    - src/store/db/helpers.go       (finalizeTransaction)

  Previous model checking found three real bugs:
    1. Orphaned intents from premature txn record cleanup
    2. HLC timestamp collisions during concurrent commits
    3. OCC lost update: two txns reading the same version could both commit
       because checkVersionPredicates only checked committed versions, not
       pending intents (fixed by hasConflictingIntentForKey in PR #381)

  This spec models the OCC predicate check faithfully as two separate steps
  with a window between them (CheckPredicates snapshots committed versions,
  WriteIntentOnShard validates and writes). This structure is what allowed
  the Piledriver spec to catch bug #3 -- the window between snapshot and
  write is where concurrent transactions can interleave.

  Protocol summary:
    Phase 1 (Prepare):
      1. Orchestrator allocates HLC timestamp, creates txn record on coordinator
         shard with status=Pending and participant list.
      2. Orchestrator snapshots committed key versions (OCC read set).
      3. Orchestrator writes intents to all participant shards in parallel.
         Each shard validates OCC predicates (committed version unchanged AND
         no conflicting intents from other txns) before accepting intents.
      4. If any shard rejects (OCC conflict), orchestrator aborts.
    Phase 2 (Commit/Abort):
      5. Orchestrator atomically sets txn record to Committed (or Aborted).
      6. Orchestrator notifies participants to resolve intents (apply or discard).
      7. Each participant resolves intents and reports back.
    Recovery:
      8. Coordinator's recovery loop retries unresolved participants.
      9. Txn record is only deleted when all participants have resolved.

  Safety properties:
    - Atomicity:  Aborted txn writes never appear in the data store.
    - No orphaned intents: Txn records not deleted while intents exist.
    - OCC serialization: Conflicting OCC txns can't both have intents written.
    - LWW consistency: Higher-timestamp writes win during intent resolution.
    - Serializable reads: Two txns that read the same version of a key
      cannot both commit (catches the lost update bug).

  Liveness properties (under weak fairness):
    - Committed intents are eventually all resolved.
    - Fully resolved txn records are eventually cleaned up.
    - Every transaction eventually reaches a terminal decision.

  intents. The window between this snapshot and WriteIntentOnShard is
  where the lost update vulnerability exists.
  Maps to: the client-side Read that captures versions, which are later

  Validates OCC predicates and writes intents on shard s.
  Checks BOTH committed version predicates AND conflicting intents.
  This models the FIXED code (post-PR #381) which includes
  hasConflictingIntentForKey() in checkVersionPredicates().
  Maps to: store/db/db.go:3942 (WriteIntent) with both predicate checks.

  Coordinator aborts a transaction that is still preparing or has predicates
  checked but hasn't failed a write. This happens when:

  AtomicityInvariant:
  If a transaction is aborted, none of its writes appear in the data store

  NoOrphanedIntents:
  A transaction record must not be deleted while any intents exist in
  "written" state. Catches the orphaned intents bug (bug #1).

  Two transactions with overlapping read-write sets cannot both have intents
  in "written" state on the same shard while neither is aborted.

  higher timestamp from another transaction.

  SerializableReads:
  Two committed transactions that both checked the same version of a key
  in their predicate snapshots cannot both have committed. This catches
  the OCC lost update bug (#3) where checkVersionPredicates only checked
  committed versions and not pending intents.
  Adapted from the Piledriver spec (occ-2pc.tla).
