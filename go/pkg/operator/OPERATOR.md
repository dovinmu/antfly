# Antfly Operator Design

This document describes the public design contract for the Antfly Kubernetes
operator. It focuses on Antfly database clusters and the custom resources that
users or external control planes should manage.

## Ownership Boundary

The operator is the authority for Kubernetes realization of an Antfly cluster:

- StatefulSets
- Services
- PersistentVolumeClaims
- PodDisruptionBudgets
- autoscaling resources
- status conditions

Users and control planes should express intent through Antfly custom resources,
primarily `AntflyCluster`. Direct edits to operator-owned child resources are not
part of the public contract and may be reconciled back to the custom resource
state.

The operator owns Kubernetes safety and database lifecycle checks. Product
layers outside the operator may own plans, limits, billing, user workflows, and
allowed sizes, but they should drive changes through the public Antfly APIs.

## Public API Contract

`AntflyCluster` is the public control surface for deploying and resizing Antfly
database clusters.

Supported intent includes:

- metadata node count and resources
- data node count and resources
- standalone-mode resources
- inference pool attachment through Inference
- metadata, data, and standalone storage sizes
- data-node autoscaling bounds
- cloud-specific placement and service settings
- backup and restore integration through the backup/restore CRDs

The operator reports progress through `status.observedGeneration` and status
conditions. Consumers should use those fields to determine whether a requested
operation has completed. Inspecting child StatefulSets, PVCs, or HPAs directly is
useful for debugging, but should not be the primary completion signal.

## Inference Inference Pools

The operator exposes Inference inference as part of the Antfly cluster contract
without collapsing Inference and Antfly into one reconciler. `AntflyCluster` is the
product-level API a user or cloud control plane can submit, while `InferencePool`
remains the reusable inference primitive with its own reconciliation loop,
autoscaling, model pullers, scheduling, and readiness conditions.

`spec.inference.mode` selects how inference capacity is provided:

- `PlatformShared`: use platform-operated shared InferencePools. These pools are
  managed outside the customer cluster and are suitable for common models,
  zero-config onboarding, and shared warm capacity.
- `Managed`: create InferencePools owned by this AntflyCluster. This is suitable
  for customer-specific models, dedicated capacity, stricter isolation, and
  cluster-local scaling rules.
- `SharedRef`: reference existing customer-managed InferencePools. This is useful
  when multiple AntflyClusters share one inference tier.
- `Disabled`: do not configure cluster-level Inference inference.

Managed pools are declared under `spec.inference.managedPools`. The operator
creates child `InferencePool` resources, sets owner references, applies the
default Inference image when the pool does not specify one, and deletes stale
owned pools when the AntflyCluster no longer requests them. The InferencePool
controller remains responsible for creating the StatefulSet, model-puller init
containers, service, HPA, scheduling, and status.

Shared and platform pools are declared under `spec.inference.sharedPools` and
`spec.inference.platformPools`. The AntflyCluster reconciler records that the
references are configured but does not mutate or delete those pools. Ownership
is explicit: referenced pools may be reused across clusters, while managed pools
belong to the declaring AntflyCluster.

Model references in InferencePool specs are canonical tags in
`models.preload[].name`, for example:

```yaml
models:
  preload:
    - name: BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5:i8
    - name: hf:antflydb/clipclap:gguf:Q4_K
      tasks: ["embed"]
      capabilities: ["text", "image", "audio"]
```

The operator should not synthesize a separate model `variant` field. The Zig
runtime contract is `/antfly inference pull <model-ref> --models-dir /models`,
with `--tasks` and `--capabilities` added when the model preload spec declares
them.

Preload order is significant: the runtime warms `preload` entries sequentially,
in list order, at startup. The InferencePool controller emits entries ordered
by `models.preload[].priority` (`high` before `medium` before `low`; ties keep
declaration order), so higher-priority models finish loading, and become
servable, first. `priority` does not influence eviction under `lazy` or
`bounded` loading strategies — the runtime has no priority-aware eviction, only
idle-timeout (`keepAlive`) and LRU-bounded (`maxLoadedModels`) policies.

### Standalone Inference

`spec.standalone.inference.enabled` (default `true`) controls whether the
standalone pod runs Antfly's embedded, in-process inference provider.
`spec.standalone.inference.apiURL` must stay empty for that embedded provider
to run: a non-empty `apiURL` is a hard isolation contract in the Zig runtime —
it disables the embedded provider, preloads, and the `/ai/v1` routes, and
standalone expects a real listener at that address instead. The operator
therefore never invents an `apiURL` default; it only ever emits one when the
user (or `spec.config`) explicitly sets it, to point standalone at an
external/shared inference endpoint. `status.standaloneStatus.inferenceReady`
tracks the standalone pod's own readiness, which is an accurate proxy for
embedded-provider health but not for the reachability of a user-supplied
external endpoint.

### Process Memory Budget

Standalone and InferencePool pods commonly run Burstable (memory request below
limit), where Kubernetes does not otherwise expose the intended operating
envelope to the container. When a pod has an explicit memory limit, the
operator sets `ANTFLY_PROCESS_MEMORY_BUDGET_MB` to roughly 90% of that limit
(in MiB) on the runtime container, so the process throttles itself ahead of
the kernel OOM killer. No value is set when the pod has no memory limit.

## Storage Resize

Antfly storage changes are grow-only.

Users may increase:

- `spec.storage.standaloneStorage`
- `spec.storage.metadataStorage`
- `spec.storage.dataStorage`

The operator rejects disk shrink and storage class changes. Storage expansion is
tracked against both existing PVCs and StatefulSet volume claim templates so that
current pods and future replicas converge on the requested size.

Storage progress is reported through the `PVCExpansion` condition. Its reason
identifies the current state:

- `PVCExpansionPending`
- `PVCExpansionInProgress`
- `PVCExpansionComplete`
- `PVCExpansionFailed`

Condition messages should identify the affected component and PVC where
possible.

## Resource Resize

CPU and memory changes are expressed through the `AntflyCluster` spec.

Standalone mode uses:

- `spec.standalone.resources`

Distributed mode uses:

- `spec.metadataNodes.resources`
- `spec.dataNodes.resources`

The operator applies resource changes by updating the managed StatefulSet pod
templates and reporting rollout progress through status.

Rollout progress is reported through the `Rollout` condition. Its reason
identifies the current state:

- `RolloutInProgress`
- `RolloutComplete`
- `RolloutFailed`

## Data Node Scaling

Data nodes are horizontally scalable. Increasing `spec.dataNodes.replicas` or
raising autoscaling bounds is safe when the requested shape passes validation.

Scale-down is more sensitive because the database must drain or rebalance data
before a StatefulSet replica can be removed. The operator handles data-node
scale-down one ordinal at a time and reports the active step in
`status.dataScaleDownStatus`.

The scale-down workflow:

1. Observe desired data replicas below current replicas.
2. Select candidate ordinals, typically highest ordinal first.
3. Mark the selected node as draining in status.
4. Ask the Antfly runtime to drain, rebalance, and remove membership.
5. Wait for runtime confirmation.
6. Reduce StatefulSet replicas.
7. Report completion or failure conditions.

The `Scaling` condition reports whether scaling can proceed safely. Its reasons
include:

- `ScalingReady`
- `DataScaleDownBlocked`
- `DataScaleDownInProgress`
- `DataScaleDownFailed`

## Metadata Node Safety

Metadata nodes participate in consensus, so metadata scaling has stricter
validation than data-node scaling.

The operator enforces:

- odd metadata replica counts
- immutable metadata replica counts after cluster creation; both scale-up and
  scale-down require a backup/restore into a differently named cluster with
  fresh metadata PVCs at the target topology
- production configurations with enough replicas for quorum, typically at least
  three metadata nodes

Validation errors are returned by the webhook when enabled. The reconciler still
defends the same safety invariants when webhooks are unavailable. Kubernetes
1.25+ can additionally enforce the CRD CEL transition rule at API admission by
installing `kustomize/overlays/kubernetes-1.25`; the webhook and reconciler
remain authoritative on Kubernetes 1.23-1.24. Automatic CRD bootstrap and the
embedded `manifests.AllCRDsYAML()` bundle intentionally install the compatible
baseline rather than selecting an overlay from the cluster version.

Do not delete and recreate the same `AntflyCluster` name or reuse retained
metadata PVCs to change the replica count. StatefulSet and PVC names are
deterministic, so doing so can remount the old one-voter state into the new
topology and recreate the divergent-Raft failure. Back up, restore into fresh
storage under a different cluster name, and cut over instead. The controller
persists the accepted count in `status.metadataTopologyReplicas` and the
`antfly.io/metadata-topology-replicas` annotation on each metadata PVC.

## Autoscaling

When data-node autoscaling is disabled, desired data replicas come from
`spec.dataNodes.replicas`.

When data-node autoscaling is enabled, the operator computes desired replicas
within the configured minimum and maximum bounds. `status.autoScalingStatus`
reports enough information for users and control planes to understand
autoscaling decisions:

- current replicas
- desired replicas
- autoscaler recommendation
- blocked scale-down reason, if any
- rollout or resize progress

Autoscaling follows the same safety rules as manual scaling. Autoscaler
scale-down uses the same one-ordinal-at-a-time data-node scale-down workflow.

## Public Status Model

Consumers should wait for:

- `status.observedGeneration` to match the resource generation they submitted
- relevant resize, rollout, storage, or scaling conditions to become complete
- failure conditions to remain absent

The operator should prefer explicit, user-actionable conditions over requiring
users to infer progress from Kubernetes child resources.

Useful public condition types include:

- `Available`
- `ConfigurationValid`
- `SecretsReady`
- `StorageHealthy`
- `PVCExpansion`
- `StorageAutoGrow`
- `Rollout`
- `Scaling`
- `MetadataReady`
- `DataReady`
- `StandaloneReady`

Common public reason values include:

- `ValidationPassed`
- `ValidationFailed`
- `AllSecretsFound`
- `StorageHealthy`
- `PVCExpansionPending`
- `PVCExpansionInProgress`
- `PVCExpansionComplete`
- `PVCExpansionFailed`
- `StorageAutoGrowDisabled`
- `StorageAutoGrowReady`
- `StorageAutoGrowInProgress`
- `StorageAutoGrowMaxReached`
- `RolloutInProgress`
- `RolloutComplete`
- `RolloutFailed`
- `ScalingReady`
- `DataScaleDownBlocked`
- `DataScaleDownInProgress`
- `DataScaleDownFailed`

## Out Of Scope

The public Antfly operator design does not expose implementation details such as
internal controller package layout, release migration history, or downstream
repository cleanup tasks. Those details belong in work logs or development notes,
not in this public-facing design contract.
